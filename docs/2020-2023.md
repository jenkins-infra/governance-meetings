        * Would need GitHub Sponsors to transfer to a Stripe account, then to LFX account
        * LF Charities is a non-profit
    * GitHub supports concept of fiscal hosts and CNCF and Linux Foundation use OpenCollective that might be possible to use
        * GitHub transfers to OpenCollective account of Linux Foundation as fiscal host
    * No observed demand that we should enable GitHub Sponsors

* Budget and expenses - Mark Waite
    * All expenses correctly shown on the [Linux Foundation crowdfunding site](https://crowdfunding.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/projects/jenkins/financial)
* LFX Tooling - Alex Brandes
    * Jenkins project piloted into LFX Security, Alex was exploring it a few weeks ago
        * Why not onboarded the main Jenkins project into LFX Security
        * Pilot project was paused while we waited for the Linux foundation
            * LFX Security could not handle exceptions and false positive handling
                * Snyk allowed it, but subset allowed for LFX Security did not allow it
            * Talked to LFX Security team and finally suspended effort
        * Still no global configuration
            * It would have high rate of false positives with no easy way to exclude
            * Java packaging of Jenkins plugins needs special handling that is not available
        * Could enable it for Jenkins core but not workable for Jenkins plugins
            * Dependencies on other plugins are assumed to be a bundled dependency
                * False positive when plugin A declares a dependency on older version of plugin B
            * Can be done with Snyk and some custom work, but not with LFX Security
    * LFX tooling working group inside the CDF that has started their meetings
        * Tracy Ragan leading, Mark has attended past meetings, invite Alex Brandes to the meetings
        * Expanded scope of LFX Security might be worth more investigation
* Community activity
    * Artifactory bandwidth reduction project [https://repo.jenkins-ci.org](https://repo.jenkins-ci.org)
        * JFrog has asked that we switch our mirrored repositories (repo-1, jgit, etc.) from public to private so that they are not misused as caches by others

            * Adjust parent poms to declare multiple repositories
    * Jenkins security team reviewing core pull requests to JavaScript and Jelly for next 2 months
        * Details in the [June 21, 2023 UX SIG meeting](https://community.jenkins.io/t/user-experience-sig-jun-21-2023/8116)
        * Alex Brandes requested 3 reviews and they were reviewed within a few hours of the request

## March 20, 2023

Participants: Mark Waite, Basil Crow, Alexander Brandes, Bruno Verachten, Oleg Nenashev, Daniel Beck

Agenda:

* Claim from BMC to GitHub Trust and Safety ([update center PR 692](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/update-center2/pull/692))
    * Late last week GitHub owners received a report of claim of publication of private information, copyrighted material, or password without consent
        * Tim asked the committers what is happening
        * Daniel filed a pull request to stop distribution of BMC Compuware plugins
        * Maintainer replied by fixing it to rewrite the repository history (as recommended by GitHub)
        * Immediate notification was addressed but organization claimed its own published sources as private information was inconsistent
        * Nov 2022 several BMC plugins were relicensed to proprietary license (no longer OSI approved)
        * What next?
            * Suspend everything from BMC
            * Decide how to proceed next
            * Do they want to remain hosted?
            * Why was a claim filed?
            * Do we need to delete or remove artifacts?
            * Copyright claim was in tests, but if in source files, then should we remove it from artifact repository
        * Mail arrived last Friday or last Saturday
        * If GitHub gives us only 3 days to respond, then we are almost out of time to respond
        * Plugin is published by BMC with a copyright claim by BMC
            * Delete it out of principle, let their customers complain
            * Suspend distribution immediately (easy to do, 1 pull request)
            * Can block further plugin releases until issue is resolved
            * Could move the artifacts into a private repository so that they are not available from repo.jenkins-ci.org (similar to how we stage security releases)
            * Removing old versions with an OSI complaint license seems too much
        * Complaint is filed against the repository
            * Make the repository private or transfer it to a different organization temporarily
            * Do not want to risk the rest of the jenkinsci organization
            * Before publication, need a resolution to the license issue
            * Make the repository private first, then …
            * Transfer the repository to an organization defined by the plugin maintainers, then they submit a hosting request to ask for Jenkins hosting
            * If they do not repair the licensing, the transfer remains permanent and the plugin remains no longer published
        * GitHub trust and safety needs immediate action
            * Don’t risk that we’re locked out of GitHub by bogus claims to GitHub Trust and Safety
            * When a repository is made private, it detaches the fork network
                * Consider search for other risky strings, make those repos private as well
            * Suspend the plugins
            * Daniel PR suggests suspending all Compuware and BMC plugins
                * That may be more than we need, since license and GitHub Trust and Safety are limited to a few plugins, specifically previously owned by Compuware
            * What do the maintainers need to do to restore distribution?
                * Active confirmation that other BMC repositories are approved
        * Proposals for discussion
            * Make Compuware / BMC repositories private, pending confirmation that GitHub Trust & Safety claims have been rescinded and no future claims will be made
                * Alternative 0 - Do not do anything
                * Alternative 1- Only common-configuration
                * **Alternative 1.5 - Only common-configuration until the second complaint, then everything (Basil, DB, Oleg, Alex, Mark)**
                * Alternative 2 - All (preferred by Basil)
                * Alternative 3 - Any plugins that would match the complaint
                * Alternative 4 - Alternative 1 **and **Transfer repository to one or more maintainers
                * Alternative 5 - Alternative 2 **and **Transfer repository to one or more maintainers (Bruno)
                * Alternative 6 - Alternative 3 **and **Transfer repository to one or more maintainers
            * Block future releases of non-OSI Compuware / BMC plugins, pending restoration of OSI compatible license
                * Alternative 0 - Do not do anything
                * **Alternative 1 - (preferred by Basil, DB, Oleg, Alex, Mark, Bruno)**
            * Suspend distribution of Compuware / BMC plugins
                * Alternative 0 - Do not do anything
                * **Alternative 1 - suspend all, pending confirmation that GitHub Trust & Safety claims have been rescinded and no future claims will be made, and restoration of OSI compatible license (preferred by Basil, DB, Alex, Mark)**
                * Alternative 2 - remove non-compliant licensed plugin releases, pending restoration of OSI compatible license (Oleg, Bruno)
            * Remove Compuware / BMC plugins from artifact repository
                * Alternative 0 - Do not do anything
                * Alternative 1 - remove all, pending confirmation that GitHub Trust & Safety claims have been rescinded and no future claims will be made, and restoration of OSI compatible license (easier for DB, Alex, Mark, Basil)
                * **Alternative 2 - remove non-compliant licensed plugin releases**, pending restoration of OSI compatible license (preferred by Basil, Oleg, Alex, Bruno)

    * Conclude the discussion and vote on proposal in this meeting
        * Voting on the proposal
            * Mark Waite - +1
            * Ulli Hafner - 0
            * Alex Brandes - +1
            * Basil Crow - +1
            * Kevin Martens - +1
            * Bruno Verachten - +1
        * Yes, accept the change
* [Build Monitor View](https://plugins.jenkins.io/build-monitor-plugin/) plugin - @Basil
    * Currently nonstandard: hosted in `jan-molak` GitHub organization, uses GitHub Actions for CI, and uses custom CD which creates releases on every commit (even dependency updates) with no release notes
        * Users have complained about the lack of release notes, as there is no visibility into the content of releases
    * Basil has offered to help normalize the plugin by moving to the `jenkinsci` GitHub organization, Jenkins for CI/CD, and Release Drafter
        * Would resolve the user complaint by providing release notes and avoiding releases for dependency updates
    * Jan wants to retain a note about the original author in the README and [the current non-invasive footer linking to his website](https://github.com/jan-molak/jenkins-build-monitor-plugin/blob/cf334c2e6d5704d62a6b2834fff70e26f17f48c4/build-monitor-plugin/src/main/resources/com/smartcodeltd/jenkinsci/plugins/buildmonitor/BuildMonitorView/index.jelly#L119-L130)
        * Note that the footer link has been present for as long as this plugin has been distributed on the Jenkins Update Center (JUC)
    * If board confirms these conditions are acceptable, can proceed with normalizing this plugin's hosting and release process
        * Alex agrees with Basil that the plugin should be moved to jenkinsci
            * Alex OK with the conditions requested by the author
        * Ulli agrees with Basil that it should be moved to jenkinsci
            * If someone objects to the links in the plugin, they could fork
        * Basil notes that it is good to normalize and assure consistency
            * Test suite execution was also a condition, but suite is broken, needs discussion to move it without running tests or if Jan is willing to make the tests work
            * Tests use a non-standard test harness
    * Votes to approve - Ulli +1, Alex +1, Basil +1, Kevin +1, Bruno +1, Mark +1
* Governance board meeting time and date
    * [Doodle poll](https://doodle.com/meeting/participate/id/aQnyomYb) confirmed 5 of 5 responses can meet at 7:00 PM Mondays

* [[JENKINS-68652](https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-68652)] Migrate from ANTLR2 to ANTLR4 - Basil
    * Jenkins has two ANTLR grammars: one to parse (a variation of) crontab entries and one to parse label expressions for build agents
    * As described in [JENKINS-68652](https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-68652), compiling Jenkins on Java 18 or newer currently fails in ANTLR Maven Plugin
        * Our versions of ANTLR and ANTLR Maven Plugin, dating back 15 years, use terminally deprecated Java features
        * The repository for the latter does not appear to have survived the MojoHaus migration from Subversion to Git
        * The status quo does not seem sustainable
    * Given the lack of volunteer interest in JENKINS-68652 or alternatives (e.g., writing a new parser without ANTLR), Basil Crow has reached out to Federico Tomassetti at Strumenta, a consulting firm with experience performing migrations from ANTLR2 to ANTLR4
    * Strumenta is interested in the project and has scoped the work required to migrate from ANTLR2 to ANTLR4
        * Technical consensus has been reached on the [developer mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/jenkinsci-dev/c/bGmc9bc0mp4/m/i1BhSIp-AAAJ)
        * **[Proposal from Strumenta](https://app.pandadoc.com/document/55d611d49988df16a2c043c5669b679a282d04dc)**
    * Basil is requesting funding of 1,900 Euro, possibly with additional Value-Added Tax (VAT), and approval from the governance board to engage Strumenta to begin the project
        * If approved, Basil plans to be the primary point of contact with the Strumenta as they prepare the pull request to migrate from ANTLR2 to ANTLR4
        * The code is covered by automated testing, and Basil plans to complete additional manual smoke testing beyond that
        * Basil also plans to review and approve the pull request
        * As thanks for their discount, we will publish a blog post with technical content describing their work and our results of their work.  Basil will coordinate the blog post with Strumenta
    * Votes on the proposal
        * Mark - +1
        * Gavin - +1
        * Oleg - +1
        * Ewelina -

            * Oleg Nenashev has permission, approved a previous request
            * Would need to add Strumenta as a beneficiary on Expensify, then they submit the expense and Oleg approves

                * Further motivation to get people off the Blue Ocean container
                * May need further changes in the official Jenkins container as well

            * If the reader uses the canonical URL, might change (was pointing to an obsolete URL)
* Review criteria for some parts of the project
    * Reviewers would approve a contribution or approve the exact opposite
        * Do we look at the merit of the change critically enough to reject the exact opposite
            * Font was recently changed to default system font, noted that change not wanted in the pull request, but was then merged anyway

        * Case of isolation where the contributor focuses on their specific needs
            * Don’t understand the larger picture

            * Engage with the community as a whole rather than a small subset
        * CSS issues in the jenkins.io page that was not known to many contributors
            * No comments on the rationale for specific CSS entries
        * We have jenkins.io test deployments that make it very convenient to compare the live site and the test site in a side by side view
            * May miss changes that impact a small subset of pages
            * Similar pattern to the UI changes in core pull requests
            * Consider self-review in GitHub to give more explanation on subtle changes
        * Could do a “side-by-side” comparison screenshot to show the “before” and “after” to show the changes in the page(s)
* Forums and community topics
    * [Comments on RCE post](https://community.jenkins.io/t/spring-framework-rce-cve-2022-22965/1981/2)
        * Spring Boot comments on Discourse closed (asking for info on newer issues)
            * [Canned response](https://www.jenkins.io/security/)
                * Do not contact the Jenkins security team asking us for compliance documents, certifications, or to fill out a questionnaire. We will not respond to such queries. If we consider it necessary to provide a statement in response to incidents such as log4shell or SpringShell, you will find a response in our blog.
            * Two requests that arrived on the wrong topic
        * Dependency vulnerabilities sometimes reported in Jenkins Jira or security list
            * Commonly respond that we are not affected
    * Higher than normal jenkinsapi (python) questions
        * Not clear what has changed, surprising that there are many together
        * The Jenkins API python package is published through the Python packaging system, source code is not in the Jenkins GitHub organization
    * Needs Answers:
        * [[Stapler Framework Support for IntelliJ] To be renamed to Jenkins Development Support?](https://groups.google.com/g/jenkinsci-dev/c/B8Z23mKc7fo)
            * Licensing and naming
        * [Prettier for formatting supported languages in Jenkins core](https://groups.google.com/g/jenkinsci-dev/c/poYc0ptrfuw)

            * Tim requested review from Jenkins core last week, approved by Basil
                * Needs a second approval
                * Requested review today from core PR reviewers
        * [Forked repositories in GitHub](https://groups.google.com/g/jenkinsci-dev/c/SkKoCccPrOc)
            * Some concerns that we may need to do it again in the future
            * Agreed to do it for the legacy plugins (no dissent from others)
            * Bulk action on a large number of repositories, be sure that we check the bulk action is sensible.  Check the list of repository targets

    * Latest version of Jenkins not conducive to IE 11 users
    * Be clear what we test or how to see what we test
    * Core support is not a mandate for plugins
    * Can be more aggressive, but not a practical change of behavior
        * Drop it, announce the drop
    * In the changelog but no blog post needed
        * Entry in the upgrade guide for that LTS release
* EasyCLA status report - Oleg Nenashev
    * Met with LFX team to review rollout approach for Jenkins
    * Concerned that we aren’t ready to rollout to 3000 repositories all at once
    * We have EasyCLA deployed to the infra-cla repository
        * Needs a documentation update
    * Need an update to jenkins-infra
        * Made the request to the .github repository, granted
        * A “test drive” in that repository
    * CLA not enforced on repositories and branches today
        * Previous behavior continues
    * If we want to enable EasyCLA, enable as a GitHub App
        * Single CLA that can be individually enabled for specific repos
    * EasyCLA covers the entire CDF organization
    * We have it installed on jenkinsci and jenkins-infra organizations
    * As desired, we enable it on one repo at a time
    * Not importing the old CLA’s
    * Individuals would need to submit a CLA or
        * company could submit a company CLA
* LFX Insights currently disabled for Jenkins project
    * Submit a ticket to Linux Foundation if we want to enable it
    * GitHub contributions, social media, etc. aggregated to show project health
    * Metrics and analytics
    * Oleg is enabling it for Keptn, willing to help enable it for Jenkins if desired
* Highlights from the mailing lists and [community forum](https://community.jenkins.io/)
    * LTS baseline [selected - 2.332](https://groups.google.com/g/jenkinsci-dev/c/Y54Ue_f8LDs/m/_vywNdCBAwAJ)
    * 2.319.3 [release candidate](https://groups.google.com/g/jenkinsci-dev/c/YFynBK9_4zA/m/3VRiCZ6iAAAJ) ready to test
    * Meeting minutes are well received on community site
    * Contributor summit discussion started a week ago about cdCon
        * Should we do it?
        * Oleg would prefer to have two separate events rather than a hybrid event
        * Oleg not sure if he’ll be able to attend cdCon
        * Mark plans to attend cdCon in Austin
    * Kubecon in Valencia
        * There is a bar named “Jenkin’s”, could meet there if people attending

    * LFX EasyCLA - consider using a joint CDF account, waiting for the CDF response.
        21. LF suggests using the modified Apache Foundation ICLA/CCLA. “these are intended to be identical in license scope, obligations, etc. as the Apache Software Foundation CLAs, but have some streamlined administrative changes. Those are primarily by removing the appendices at the end of the standard ASF CCLA, and making clear in Sections 4 and 8 how the CLA Manager and CLA Tool concepts work. One note, we will be updating these to replace the point of contact at the very beginning for where to email signed CLAs if someone signs them outside of EasyCLA.”
        22. Oleg: some companies may want to restrict the scope, e.g. prohibit employees from contributing to another non-Jenkins
        23. Voting:

            * Go with CDF: Ulli

        24. Existing signed CLAs would need to be resigned as terms are very very slightly different to support EasyCLA
    * LFX Crowdfunding - open action items for Expensify
        25. Oleg will add other board members to crowdfunding
        26. Oleg will reach out to SPI to find out expectations of old account

        27. A few mentor applications have come in
        28. Is currently abstract “Contribute to jenkins” and we will figure out details later
        29. LFX Mentorships can be crowdfunded
        30. Have budget to fund mentees (Cannot pay salaries, but stipends and swag and stuff)
* Promoting the Jenkins X 3.x release
    * [https://groups.google.com/g/jenkins-advocacy-and-outreach-sig/c/bPROb3pncI8](https://groups.google.com/g/jenkins-advocacy-and-outreach-sig/c/bPROb3pncI8)

        38. Case Studies

Elections feedback. Expectations from the board

* Continue to lead and guide the Jenkins project
* Work closely with CDF to let us know what the community needs and how we're doing
* Transparency and empathy
* Drive and facilitate the Jenkins roadmap, make Jenkins the bet place to contribute!
* Solid stewardship, relaxing closed source restrictions
* Continue to provide guidance on best practices, and to organize events such as hacktoberfest and GSOC.
* Not expecting any big change, keep up the good work! AFAICT Jenkins is really healthy as an opensource community, very mature but yet still lively and welcoming. I guess good governance made that possible, and I can only hope it will continue.
* I am pretty new in the organization so I don't have a real based opinion. Will decide based on what each candidate says.
* "The major change I would like to see is the way we triage issues. We keep unrelevant issues opened (not reproductible, rotten etc...), the same for issues that will never be worked (out of scope, too specific, no interest etc...)...
* This pollute the tracker, makes the life of the maintainers harder and (to my opinion) gives an impression of lack of maintenance from the outside."
* I think we need a concerted push towards modernizing Jenkins at all levels. My principal interest in the OSS community is the UI, but Jenkins requires modernization at all levels.
* Further roadmap modernization
* To keep the positive evolution from previous years
* Keep up with the roadmap and initiatives that have been done.
* Keep with the election process since it adds diversity.
* Avoid any kind of bottlenecks when depending on individuals.
* Keep up the good work! Maintaining the balance between compatibility and evolution is difficult, and looking for ways to incorporate fresh external ideas while keeping that balance would be great.
* Continue developing and growing the Jenkins community
* Keep the community healthy
* make easier to contribute to the community
* The elected people continue doing the great work is doing the latest years
* Foster community, set roadmap, smoothen processes
* Continue being open and looking out for ways to involve more motivated contributors
* Orchestrate the rejuvenation of Jenkins
* Maintain a good direction for the Jenkins project, solve issues that cannot be solved by developers on Gitter/IRC/JIRA/etc
* Leading the community so that Jenkins gets higher stability and more sophisticated UX.
* Help the contributor community focus on important stuff, build relations with commercial partners and advertise Jenkins through events.
* Focus on diversifying the Jenkins project beyond CI/CD (where competition is intensifying). Continue  support for free style projects and improve/modernize Jenkins UI . Champion other disciplines (such as life/data science) where Jenkins has a proven record of capability, but poor adoption.
* Driving Jenkins toward a more modern and cloud-native architecture.
* Keep pushing for Jenkins to be the pioneer it was
* Serving the community by helping organize various efforts, sheep herding, that sort of thing.
* I expect that board will keep Jenkins the 1st CI/CD tool chain. To stay 1st, Jenkins should continue to innovate and should stay simple.

        * Governance Board votes: 3 +1s for Controller, 2 abstained
        * +1 from Mark as Documentation officer
    * Gender recommendation for localizations selection:
        * Alex: Take a feminine language
        * Oleg: Russian historically uses masculine term for a gender-neutral definition is needed (or two gender mentions)
        * Mark: Leave it to localization communities?
            * Q: How do other projects handle that?
            * Kick-off the discussion when there is a Jenkins core or jenkins.io pull request. Stall the pull request (“on-hold” label) and kick-off the discussion in the developer mailing list OR in a Chinese Localization SIG mailing list. Native speakers are expected to reach a consensus.
            * Introduce a page with term recommendations, update it as we go
                * Add localization recommendations to  [https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/glossary/](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/glossary/) incrementally
