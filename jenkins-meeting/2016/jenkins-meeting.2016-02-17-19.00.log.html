<a name="l-35"></a><span class="tm">19:06:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;danielbeck&gt;</span> and we found an actual problem in the RC and fixed it
<a name="l-36"></a><span class="tm">19:06:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;oleg-nenashev&gt;</span> We've discovered 1 critical issue yesterday, so maybe we need a new RC
<a name="l-37"></a><span class="tm">19:06:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ogondza&gt;</span> <span class="hi">kohsuke:</span> 2016-02-24 is good for you?

<a name="l-39"></a><span class="tm">19:07:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> are we going to cut a new RC?
<a name="l-40"></a><span class="tm">19:07:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> Yes, that date'll be good
<a name="l-41"></a><span class="tm">19:07:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> <span class="cmd">#info </span><span class="cmdline">new LTS date is planned for 2016-02-24</span>
<a name="l-42"></a><span class="tm">19:07:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;danielbeck&gt;</span> oleg-nenashev Are you also referring to the GroovyHookScript one?
<a name="l-43"></a><span class="tm">19:07:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;oleg-nenashev&gt;</span> +1 for the new RC. Groovy Hooks are in the bad shape in RC-1
<a name="l-44"></a><span class="tm">19:07:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;oleg-nenashev&gt;</span> <span class="hi">danielbeck:</span> yes

<a name="l-46"></a><span class="tm">19:08:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;danielbeck&gt;</span> TBH this doesn't look like it's severe enough to redo the RC
<a name="l-47"></a><span class="tm">19:08:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ogondza&gt;</span> Will we move the cycle by one week?
<a name="l-48"></a><span class="tm">19:08:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ogondza&gt;</span> <span class="hi">danielbeck:</span> could not hurt
<a name="l-49"></a><span class="tm">19:08:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">ogondza:</span> we talked about your producing LTS RCs going forward, should we do that starting here? Or I'm happy to produce RC too
<a name="l-50"></a><span class="tm">19:08:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;oleg-nenashev&gt;</span> <span class="hi">danielbeck:</span> Depends on the environment. Many people rely on hooks
<a name="l-51"></a><span class="tm">19:09:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;oleg-nenashev&gt;</span> But I have no strong opinion. Now we test the custom core build
<a name="l-52"></a><span class="tm">19:09:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ogondza&gt;</span> <span class="hi">kohsuke:</span> yes, lets discus detail after the meeting (are there any)

<a name="l-55"></a><span class="tm">19:10:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;danielbeck&gt;</span> ogondza I don't think we should move the schedule
<a name="l-56"></a><span class="tm">19:10:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;danielbeck&gt;</span> it's quite useful to have it match the meeting schedule

<a name="l-58"></a><span class="tm">19:10:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> do we have enough covered for this topic in the meeting to where follow-ups can happen immediately after?
<a name="l-59"></a><span class="tm">19:11:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> +1 on danielbeck that we should stick to the same cycle as this meeting
<a name="l-60"></a><span class="tm">19:11:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> if that's not contested, then we can move on, I think

<a name="l-64"></a><span class="tm">19:12:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> so let me first apologize on behalf of CloudBees for epicly dropping the ball on this
<a name="l-65"></a><span class="tm">19:12:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> the last meeting CloudBees shared updates on this was mid-last year, which is not okay
<a name="l-66"></a><span class="tm">19:13:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> in the last meeting about this there were a number of loose ends and questions which I have tried and answer in the above wiki page
<a name="l-67"></a><span class="tm">19:13:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> this includes questions from ogondza, orrc and KostyaSha
<a name="l-68"></a><span class="tm">19:14:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> additionally for a number of reasons we were not able to get a non-CloudBees affiliated member of the community involved the with certification advisory board, so I would like to ask for anybody interested in that to ping me at my work email (tyler@cloudbees.com)
<a name="l-69"></a><span class="tm">19:15:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> <span class="cmd">#info </span><span class="cmdline">Certification Advisory Board details: https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Jenkins+Certification#JenkinsCertification-AdvisoryBoard</span>
<a name="l-70"></a><span class="tm">19:15:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;batmat&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Nitpicking:</span> shouldn't, like for Jenkins the app itself, it be named something like *CloudBees* Jenkins Certification?
<a name="l-71"></a><span class="tm">19:16:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> that's not nitpicking that touches on one of the things we've dropped the ball on :)
<a name="l-72"></a><span class="tm">19:16:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;batmat&gt;</span> :)
<a name="l-73"></a><span class="tm">19:16:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;oleg-nenashev&gt;</span> And the program is already announced, right?
<a name="l-74"></a><span class="tm">19:16:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> so before I jump to that, one of the major themes of questions originally was around financing of this operation
<a name="l-75"></a><span class="tm">19:16:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> it's safe to safe that CloudBees is definitely not making money on this :P
<a name="l-76"></a><span class="tm">19:17:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> safe to say*
<a name="l-77"></a><span class="tm">19:17:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> I've tried to detail what I'm able to detail around the financing of this in the document, no Jenkins project funds are being used here
<a name="l-78"></a><span class="tm">19:17:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> <span class="hi">oleg-nenashev:</span> yes, the program is already announced, which is part of the previously mentioned ball dropping :P
<a name="l-79"></a><span class="tm">19:18:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;oleg-nenashev&gt;</span> OK, I have to abstain from this discussion in any case
<a name="l-80"></a><span class="tm">19:18:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> <span class="hi">batmat:</span> so CloudBees Jenkins implies a specific "distribution" of Jenkins that CloudBees releases
<a name="l-81"></a><span class="tm">19:18:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> so CloudBees has developed a "CloudBees Jenkins Certification" program *and* a "Jenkins Certification" program
<a name="l-82"></a><span class="tm">19:19:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;batmat&gt;</span> <span class="hi">rtyler:</span> yeah, so more like Jenkins *CloudBees* Certification :)
<a name="l-83"></a><span class="tm">19:19:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> the Jenkins Certification program is oriented 100% around the Jenkins open source project
<a name="l-84"></a><span class="tm">19:19:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> it is this program we're discussing here, and what CloudBees really needs (in my personal opinion) an non-CloudBees affiliated member of the community on the certification advisory board
<a name="l-85"></a><span class="tm">19:19:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> SO
<a name="l-86"></a><span class="tm">19:19:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> lots of updates AMIRITE
<a name="l-87"></a><span class="tm">19:20:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;batmat&gt;</span> <span class="hi">rtyler:</span> yes, I've read that. Just saying that that wording may imply this is the officially blessed/only one for the Jenkins community project, when some other (hypothetic, granted) companies could do the same
<a name="l-88"></a><span class="tm">19:20:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> to my knowedge, to date, no other companies have invested in creating such a program
<a name="l-89"></a><span class="tm">19:20:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> The intent has been to make this program belong to the  community --- I think such certification has more values to those who take them and to this community.
<a name="l-90"></a><span class="tm">19:21:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;KostyaSha&gt;</span> please define what is community
<a name="l-91"></a><span class="tm">19:23:33 </span><span class="nka">* rtyler</span> <span class="ac">things of non-snarky ways to answer that</span>
<a name="l-92"></a><span class="tm">19:23:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;batmat&gt;</span> <span class="hi">rtyler:</span> sure, hence my /hypothetic/
<a name="l-93"></a><span class="tm">19:24:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> <span class="hi">KostyaSha:</span> is your question not really answered in the introduction of the wiki page I linked above?
<a name="l-94"></a><span class="tm">19:24:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> at least as far as the intended audience and purpose of the certification program
<a name="l-95"></a><span class="tm">19:26:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> so the second part of this topic is the trademark sublicense request, which was mistakenly not requested previously
<a name="l-96"></a><span class="tm">19:27:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> <span class="cmd">#info </span><span class="cmdline">the two derivative marks CloudBees is seeking to use are: "Jenkins Certification" to refer to the Jenkins open source related certification program, and "Certified Jenkins Engineer" to be used to reference practitioners who successfully complete the open-source related exam</span>

<a name="l-98"></a><span class="tm">19:30:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;KostyaSha&gt;</span> Are questions available somewhere? Some examples
<a name="l-99"></a><span class="tm">19:30:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;autojack&gt;</span> so the topic on the table is approval for CloudBees to use these marks?
<a name="l-100"></a><span class="tm">19:30:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;orrc&gt;</span> <span class="hi">KostyaSha:</span> there's a study guide on the CB page with some samples

<a name="l-103"></a><span class="tm">19:31:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;KostyaSha&gt;</span> orrc, i thought non CB part was already done and now request is only about CB
<a name="l-104"></a><span class="tm">19:31:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;KostyaSha&gt;</span> orrc, will be glad to see non CB cert questions to get idea what is this about

<a name="l-109"></a><span class="tm">19:32:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;KostyaSha&gt;</span> alyssat, as foss member i'm not using any CB* staff
<a name="l-110"></a><span class="tm">19:33:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;oleg-nenashev&gt;</span> ahh, CJE = Certified Jenkins Engineer
<a name="l-111"></a><span class="tm">19:33:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;heidig__&gt;</span> CJE = Certified Jenkins Engineer
<a name="l-112"></a><span class="tm">19:33:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> we gotta stop using all these silly acronyms :P
<a name="l-113"></a><span class="tm">19:33:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;alyssat&gt;</span> <span class="hi">kostyaSha:</span> that's what currently avail.
<a name="l-114"></a><span class="tm">19:33:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;KostyaSha&gt;</span> So if the question about sub-licensing for "$company jenkins certificaiton" i would be glad to see firstly plain "jenkins certification". Either there will be possible 2 orthogonal licenses.

<a name="l-119"></a><span class="tm">19:36:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;danielbeck&gt;</span> KostyaSha See rtyler's #info above, it's one of the requested marks

<a name="l-121"></a><span class="tm">19:37:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> ... which is why the program proposal emphasizes the community oversights (aka "advisory board")
<a name="l-122"></a><span class="tm">19:37:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;KostyaSha&gt;</span> is it possible to approve everything CB wants, but without enforcing everything to Jenkins itself?
<a name="l-123"></a><span class="tm">19:38:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> <span class="hi">KostyaSha:</span> what do you mean? enforcing everything to Jenkins?
<a name="l-124"></a><span class="tm">19:38:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> And it's hard to see how anyone else wants to develop a competing certification
<a name="l-125"></a><span class="tm">19:38:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> heh
<a name="l-126"></a><span class="tm">19:38:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;KostyaSha&gt;</span> imho there is no project resources (non-CB) for making jenkins cert programs etc.
<a name="l-127"></a><span class="tm">19:38:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> developing certification examples is a great way to take a big pile of money and turn it into a small pile of money
<a name="l-128"></a><span class="tm">19:39:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> <span class="hi">KostyaSha:</span> right, and that's not great but fine from my perspective
<a name="l-129"></a><span class="tm">19:39:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> I really would like to see some more people express interest and commit time to help review the questions via the advisory board

<a name="l-132"></a><span class="tm">19:40:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> <span class="hi">KostyaSha:</span> given your experience level, I wouldn't imagine the questions would be terribly difficult for ou
<a name="l-133"></a><span class="tm">19:40:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;autojack&gt;</span> I've been out of the Jenkins loop for a couple of months but this sounds like something I could do.
<a name="l-134"></a><span class="tm">19:40:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;autojack&gt;</span> so there's that.
<a name="l-135"></a><span class="tm">19:41:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> going forward I believe the main effort will be around revisiting problematic/stale questions and adding new ones
<a name="l-136"></a><span class="tm">19:41:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;orrc&gt;</span> some of this feels a bit odd. community members should donate their time to help develop a proprietary set of questions, to help CloudBees charge $250 for certification :)
<a name="l-137"></a><span class="tm">19:41:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> not to derail signing autojack up for more work, but any more comments on the "Jenkins Certification" and "Certified Jenkins Engineer" marks?
<a name="l-138"></a><span class="tm">19:41:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;KostyaSha&gt;</span> rtyler, from my exp i want say that there is messy core (i.e. crazy matrix job with unclear flyweights logic) and plugins written by devs that may change in any time.
<a name="l-139"></a><span class="tm">19:42:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> FWIW I took the test and I was impressed at the quality

<a name="l-141"></a><span class="tm">19:42:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;batmat&gt;</span> I think I could help too. Though looking at the list, there's some plugins I actually never used.
<a name="l-142"></a><span class="tm">19:43:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> <span class="hi">orrc:</span> I think that's a good point we can address

<a name="l-144"></a><span class="tm">19:44:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">orrc:</span> as described in the costs/revenues it's very unlikely that we'll ever turn profits, but would it help if we commit to transfer any "profits" to SPI?
<a name="l-145"></a><span class="tm">19:44:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;KostyaSha&gt;</span> why not just make coursera course?
<a name="l-146"></a><span class="tm">19:44:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;orrc&gt;</span> a lot of this is based on good faith, e.g. making sure that the questions aren't stupid / easy, so that the community can "protect the good name of Jenkins"
<a name="l-147"></a><span class="tm">19:44:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;KostyaSha&gt;</span> people may then get 'coursera jenkins cert' for example
<a name="l-148"></a><span class="tm">19:44:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;orrc&gt;</span> but then CloudBees is also incentivised to make sure it's a decent program
<a name="l-149"></a><span class="tm">19:45:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;orrc&gt;</span> it's hard to argue against the whole thing, but it feels slightly and unhelpfully intangibly odd :)
<a name="l-150"></a><span class="tm">19:45:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> heh

<a name="l-160"></a><span class="tm">19:47:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;orrc&gt;</span> so I think it's ok. but the advisory board member(s?) should be a bit clearer; how big is the board? do community members have any power, e.g. to veto questions?

<a name="l-167"></a><span class="tm">19:48:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;orrc&gt;</span> but as the page explains, that may well be in intangible ways. which I do kinda believe in :)
<a name="l-168"></a><span class="tm">19:49:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;autojack&gt;</span> yeah, I agree about the intangibles.
<a name="l-169"></a><span class="tm">19:49:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;autojack&gt;</span> actually they are probably reasonably tangible.

<a name="l-297"></a><span class="tm">20:13:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> <span class="hi">batmat:</span> one of the things I had thought of last week was perhaps defaulting the parent pom to release into the experimental update center by default, which would satisfy nigel's concerns, and then make the jenkinsci org requirement for inclusion in latest/stable update centers
<a name="l-298"></a><span class="tm">20:14:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> now, I had this idea with very little idea of how this would actually work
<a name="l-299"></a><span class="tm">20:14:16 </span><span class="nka">* rtyler</span> <span class="ac">doesn't maven good</span>
<a name="l-300"></a><span class="tm">20:14:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;batmat&gt;</span> <span class="hi">rtyler:</span> actually, experimental is by version pattern only

<a name="l-303"></a><span class="tm">20:14:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;orrc&gt;</span> yup
<a name="l-304"></a><span class="tm">20:14:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;KostyaSha&gt;</span> why facepalm?
<a name="l-305"></a><span class="tm">20:15:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;danielbeck&gt;</span> makes the suggestion not work
<a name="l-306"></a><span class="tm">20:15:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;orrc&gt;</span> and there's no way of knowing, when generating the UC, where the plugin is hosted
<a name="l-307"></a><span class="tm">20:15:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;batmat&gt;</span> <span class="hi">rtyler:</span> but the idea is great, if it was feasible this way :)
<a name="l-308"></a><span class="tm">20:15:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;orrc&gt;</span> (though it is a good idea)
<a name="l-309"></a><span class="tm">20:15:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> With a bit of automation we could certainly do what you are suggesting
<a name="l-310"></a><span class="tm">20:15:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> <span class="hi">KostyaSha:</span> the update center generation is a /little/ ugly with various hacks like that in it :P
<a name="l-311"></a><span class="tm">20:15:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;KostyaSha&gt;</span> jenkins plugins distribution is facepalm ;)
<a name="l-312"></a><span class="tm">20:15:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> I don't want kohsuke to throw anything at me, so..no comment :)
<a name="l-313"></a><span class="tm">20:16:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;batmat&gt;</span> <span class="hi">rtyler:</span> one clean(er) solution would to redefine the distributionManagement tag so that there's many repos
<a name="l-314"></a><span class="tm">20:16:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;KostyaSha&gt;</span> batmat, that would add mess to already existing plugins/configs
<a name="l-315"></a><span class="tm">20:16:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;batmat&gt;</span> anyway, I fear we may be slightly offtopic.
<a name="l-316"></a><span class="tm">20:16:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> I forgot exactly how I did it, but we can know what repository contains what plugin and their versions
<a name="l-317"></a><span class="tm">20:17:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;orrc&gt;</span> so long as there's no check made when uploading to the repository, then that isn't really enforcable
<a name="l-318"></a><span class="tm">20:17:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> <span class="hi">batmat:</span> bring us back ontopic :)
<a name="l-319"></a><span class="tm">20:17:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;batmat&gt;</span> As stated by abayer kohsuke and many others, the fact that plugin source code has always been assumed to be under the hudson/jenkins infra has always been assumed
<a name="l-320"></a><span class="tm">20:17:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;batmat&gt;</span> the thing is, legacy.
<a name="l-321"></a><span class="tm">20:17:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> It's been assumed but not required, yeah.
<a name="l-322"></a><span class="tm">20:18:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;KostyaSha&gt;</span> or i may say that it optional
<a name="l-323"></a><span class="tm">20:18:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;KostyaSha&gt;</span> either host either not
<a name="l-324"></a><span class="tm">20:18:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;batmat&gt;</span> having had to look up a plugin source code after a user's question on #jenkins some time ago, I really feel this should be required at some point
<a name="l-325"></a><span class="tm">20:18:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;batmat&gt;</span> since there's apart from that really not a lot of enforcement
<a name="l-326"></a><span class="tm">20:18:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> Based on the defaults, I'd say hosting outside of jenkinsci org has been optional, rather than hosting inside of jenkinsci org being optional - you *can* opt out, but you have to specifically do so.
<a name="l-327"></a><span class="tm">20:18:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;batmat&gt;</span> so, IMO would sound quite reasonnable
<a name="l-328"></a><span class="tm">20:18:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> the adopt-a-plugin thing makes me feel this should be a requirement
<a name="l-329"></a><span class="tm">20:19:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> so folks can pick up on plugins that have been left behind
<a name="l-330"></a><span class="tm">20:19:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;batmat&gt;</span> <span class="hi">rtyler:</span> exactly
<a name="l-331"></a><span class="tm">20:19:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;KostyaSha&gt;</span> rtyler, in such cases they are forked
<a name="l-332"></a><span class="tm">20:19:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;KostyaSha&gt;</span> so there is no problem
<a name="l-333"></a><span class="tm">20:20:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> <span class="hi">KostyaSha:</span> that assumes that the source code was ever available
<a name="l-334"></a><span class="tm">20:20:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;danielbeck&gt;</span> KostyaSha from non public source code?
<a name="l-335"></a><span class="tm">20:20:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> one of the nigel's concern was that we might set additional bar to the entry into the jenkinsci org.
<a name="l-336"></a><span class="tm">20:20:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;KostyaSha&gt;</span> danielbeck, let's check, topic is about hosting under jenkinsci not about public/unpublic?
<a name="l-337"></a><span class="tm">20:20:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;batmat&gt;</span> with that bunch of plugins we have, unmaintained plugins arise almost every other day. And having to dig around to find the associated source code seems really a waste of time.
<a name="l-338"></a><span class="tm">20:20:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> so there are some open source projects, nibalizer from openstack was in here earlier, that host their plugins in their own open source infrastructure
<a name="l-339"></a><span class="tm">20:20:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> Maybe re-affirming that such bar shouldn't be arbitrary might help
<a name="l-340"></a><span class="tm">20:21:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> Re-affirming wouldn't hurt regardless. =)
<a name="l-341"></a><span class="tm">20:21:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> <span class="hi">KostyaSha:</span> we don't have private repos under jenkinsci fwiw
<a name="l-342"></a><span class="tm">20:22:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> I'm curious if we have proprietary plugins in our update center, and if so, do we wish to continue distributing them
<a name="l-343"></a><span class="tm">20:22:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;KostyaSha&gt;</span> rtyler, danielbeck mean sources: 1) under jenkinsci (public) 2) under user/company accounts(public) 3) unavailable at all
<a name="l-344"></a><span class="tm">20:22:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;batmat&gt;</span> We basically generally fork repo under a week, discussions/roundtrips included
<a name="l-345"></a><span class="tm">20:22:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;danielbeck&gt;</span> KostyaSha anywhere else is essentially non-public as the author can decide to delete the repo.
<a name="l-346"></a><span class="tm">20:22:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> this proposal would definitely affect those developers
<a name="l-347"></a><span class="tm">20:22:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;KostyaSha&gt;</span> danielbeck, sources will exist in jars
<a name="l-348"></a><span class="tm">20:22:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;orrc&gt;</span> <span class="hi">rtyler:</span> there may be one or two floating around; we've certainly removed a couple in the past year
<a name="l-349"></a><span class="tm">20:23:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;batmat&gt;</span> so saying this is a limiting requirement is IMO a bit excessive. It's IMO actually excessively simple to host a new plugin under the jenkinsci org...
<a name="l-350"></a><span class="tm">20:23:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;orrc&gt;</span> <span class="hi">KostyaSha:</span> someone published a plugin, which *explicitly* excluded the sources
<a name="l-351"></a><span class="tm">20:23:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;batmat&gt;</span> <span class="hi">rtyler:</span> about proprietary plugins, I'm pretty sure this was already clarified as forbidden
<a name="l-352"></a><span class="tm">20:23:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> <span class="hi">danielbeck:</span> do you have guidelines floating around for HOSTING requests? I don't want forking to be blocked by a single persons subjective opinion on the merit of a fork

<a name="l-359"></a><span class="tm">20:25:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> I could buy into the idea of an "external origin" update center that you'd end up in if your repo wasn't under jenkinsci.
<a name="l-360"></a><span class="tm">20:25:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> As long as we integrated that "external origin" UC into the default UI somehow.
<a name="l-361"></a><span class="tm">20:25:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;oleg-nenashev&gt;</span> Or just a metadata with a switch in advanced options
<a name="l-362"></a><span class="tm">20:25:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;KostyaSha&gt;</span> abayer, could you provide tooling for this? Pinnin repos, priorities, etc?
<a name="l-363"></a><span class="tm">20:25:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;oleg-nenashev&gt;</span> It should be more simple
<a name="l-364"></a><span class="tm">20:26:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> <span class="hi">KostyaSha:</span> Pinning repos?
<a name="l-365"></a><span class="tm">20:26:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;KostyaSha&gt;</span> i.e. i would like to use GH releases
<a name="l-366"></a><span class="tm">20:26:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;batmat&gt;</span> <span class="hi">abayer:</span> IIRC jglick explained a fortnight ago that actually internals already support in standard multiple UC
<a name="l-367"></a><span class="tm">20:26:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;batmat&gt;</span> just this isn't exposed
<a name="l-368"></a><span class="tm">20:26:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;orrc&gt;</span> <span class="hi">abayer:</span> Jenkins supports multiple UCs. just expose this in the UI, and let others run their own
<a name="l-369"></a><span class="tm">20:26:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;KostyaSha&gt;</span> abayer, see OpenSuse dependency management (imho the best dep solving algos)
<a name="l-370"></a><span class="tm">20:26:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> I'd say that a plugin ID would only show up in one of "external" or "primary" update centers - newest version wins.
<a name="l-371"></a><span class="tm">20:26:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> Just spitballing here. =)
<a name="l-372"></a><span class="tm">20:26:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;orrc&gt;</span> I wouldn't like to have UCs not controlled by Jenkins / hosted by others in the default Jenkins install
<a name="l-373"></a><span class="tm">20:26:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;KostyaSha&gt;</span> abayer, that's standard mistake :)

<a name="l-378"></a><span class="tm">20:27:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;batmat&gt;</span> <span class="hi">KostyaSha:</span> the one who proposes every combinatorial to support should commit to work on it
<a name="l-379"></a><span class="tm">20:27:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> For me, forcing people into this one community is a part of the explicit design to encourage co-maintainerships and etc
<a name="l-380"></a><span class="tm">20:27:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;KostyaSha&gt;</span> jglick, right, certs is issue. And later ratings and other metadata staff
<a name="l-381"></a><span class="tm">20:27:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> We'd still "support" and generate the external update center, it'd still only contain plugins in our Maven repo, it'd just be plugins with source outside of jenkinsci org.
<a name="l-382"></a><span class="tm">20:27:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> I don't want to end up with lots of micro update centers running everywhere
<a name="l-383"></a><span class="tm">20:27:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> a la experimental.
<a name="l-384"></a><span class="tm">20:28:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> (except with a better user experience that doesn't require manually adding it to get it in the in-Jenkins plugin manager)
<a name="l-385"></a><span class="tm">20:28:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;orrc&gt;</span> yeah, seems reasonable
<a name="l-386"></a><span class="tm">20:28:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;KostyaSha&gt;</span> kohsuke, UC should die, you may create repo sources in plugin manager. That how all linux distros leaving for 20 years
<a name="l-387"></a><span class="tm">20:28:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;orrc&gt;</span> ci.jenkins-ci.org groans at the additional work ;)
<a name="l-388"></a><span class="tm">20:28:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> OH GOD no.
<a name="l-389"></a><span class="tm">20:28:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> as we're running up on 90 minutes, could I ask you abayer and batmat to put together a concrete proposal on what we would move forward with here based on this feedback?
<a name="l-390"></a><span class="tm">20:29:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> Sure thing.
<a name="l-391"></a><span class="tm">20:29:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;KostyaSha&gt;</span> kohsuke, i.e. central + gh source for some plugin + gh source for other plugin
<a name="l-392"></a><span class="tm">20:29:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> I need to read nigel's concern more carefully, but I think our current proposal is sensible
<a name="l-393"></a><span class="tm">20:29:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;batmat&gt;</span> +1. Gonna be difficult to extract some seemingly beginning of consensus here, but anyway we can try
<a name="l-394"></a><span class="tm">20:30:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> <span class="cmd">#action </span><span class="cmdline">batmat and abayer to try to extract a coherent proposal based on today's IRC discussions and prior mailing list thread comments</span>
<a name="l-395"></a><span class="tm">20:30:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> fwiw, I'd even say that we only generate the "split" update centers for Jenkins releases after we've added proper integration of the split update centers in the UI, so that older versions still see what they see now.
<a name="l-396"></a><span class="tm">20:30:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> nigel has been a great member of the community with lots of popular plugins under the belt, so I want him happy
<a name="l-397"></a><span class="tm">20:30:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> that's the challenge, I guess.
<a name="l-398"></a><span class="tm">20:30:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;KostyaSha&gt;</span> lol
<a name="l-399"></a><span class="tm">20:30:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> can we button up this topic until we get a big beautiful proposal written out? :)
