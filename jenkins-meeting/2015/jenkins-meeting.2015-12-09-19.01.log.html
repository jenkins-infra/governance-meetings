<a name="l-15"></a><span class="tm">19:03:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> So the release just went out and I think it's ready
<a name="l-16"></a><span class="tm">19:03:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ogondza&gt;</span> All looks fine ,as reported
<a name="l-17"></a><span class="tm">19:03:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ogondza&gt;</span> yeah, i just noticed that

<a name="l-20"></a><span class="tm">19:04:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ogondza&gt;</span> (than at the meeting time)
<a name="l-21"></a><span class="tm">19:04:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;danielbeck&gt;</span> ogondza We need to include you in the security update process, let's discuss this separately.
<a name="l-22"></a><span class="tm">19:04:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> Yes that's true, I just assumed no news is a good news but you are right, technically I jumped the gun
<a name="l-23"></a><span class="tm">19:05:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> in any case, shall we move on?
<a name="l-24"></a><span class="tm">19:05:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ogondza&gt;</span> sure
<a name="l-25"></a><span class="tm">19:05:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;danielbeck&gt;</span> FWIW I'll email jenkinsci-advisories later today to announce it

<a name="l-28"></a><span class="tm">19:05:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;danielbeck&gt;</span> unfortunately it looks like jglick couldn't make it

<a name="l-30"></a><span class="tm">19:06:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;danielbeck&gt;</span> http://jenkins-ci.org/changelog is mixed
<a name="l-31"></a><span class="tm">19:06:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ogondza&gt;</span> mixed?
<a name="l-32"></a><span class="tm">19:06:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;danielbeck&gt;</span> no clear good release
<a name="l-33"></a><span class="tm">19:06:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;danielbeck&gt;</span> based on feedback
<a name="l-34"></a><span class="tm">19:06:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;danielbeck&gt;</span> 1.637 introduced two regressions
<a name="l-35"></a><span class="tm">19:06:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;danielbeck&gt;</span> JENKINS-31458
<a name="l-36"></a><span class="tm">19:06:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;danielbeck&gt;</span> JENKINS-31518
<a name="l-37"></a><span class="tm">19:07:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ogondza&gt;</span> 1.638 contains security fixes, that would simplify a lot of things I presume
<a name="l-38"></a><span class="tm">19:07:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;danielbeck&gt;</span> both are supposed to be fixed by now, but one has several comments indicating it's not
<a name="l-39"></a><span class="tm">19:07:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> Yeah, JENKIN-31458 fix introduced a nasty regression itself.
<a name="l-40"></a><span class="tm">19:07:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-31954
<a name="l-41"></a><span class="tm">19:08:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> May not be a hard fix, but it's definitely happening in the new code from JENKINS-31458.
<a name="l-42"></a><span class="tm">19:08:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> 1.634?
<a name="l-43"></a><span class="tm">19:08:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;danielbeck&gt;</span> so basically everything since 1.636 is somewhat broken.
<a name="l-44"></a><span class="tm">19:09:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;danielbeck&gt;</span> kohsuke Are you proposing that version?
<a name="l-45"></a><span class="tm">19:09:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> Yes
<a name="l-46"></a><span class="tm">19:10:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;danielbeck&gt;</span> it's not better than 635 because we have a fix for the one ugly bug with the JDK named null
<a name="l-47"></a><span class="tm">19:10:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> 1.635 change doesn't seem like the kinds that create many regressions so I don't know why 1.635 rating is significantly worse than 1.634 but trusting the knowledge of the crowd
<a name="l-48"></a><span class="tm">19:11:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;danielbeck&gt;</span> and 636 has very little new https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/compare/jenkins-1.635...jenkins-1.636 over that.
<a name="l-49"></a><span class="tm">19:11:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;danielbeck&gt;</span> kohsuke 6 votes for the bug in JDK selection that was since fixed
<a name="l-50"></a><span class="tm">19:12:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> If 1.636 is your proposal I'm fine with that too
<a name="l-51"></a><span class="tm">19:12:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;danielbeck&gt;</span> so IMO 635 is good, as is 636.
<a name="l-52"></a><span class="tm">19:12:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ogondza&gt;</span> 636 looks good to me
<a name="l-53"></a><span class="tm">19:12:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> You are obviously far more knowledgeable about the fixes &amp; bugs that went into those.
<a name="l-54"></a><span class="tm">19:12:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> OK, so 1.636 it is?
<a name="l-55"></a><span class="tm">19:13:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;danielbeck&gt;</span> looks like a good choice to me
<a name="l-56"></a><span class="tm">19:13:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> And I guess we can merge security-stable-1.625 to get it patched up?
<a name="l-57"></a><span class="tm">19:13:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> Any objections before settling on 1.636?
<a name="l-58"></a><span class="tm">19:14:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> <span class="cmd">#agreed </span><span class="cmdline">next LTS is 1.636 based</span>
<a name="l-59"></a><span class="tm">19:14:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> onto next?
<a name="l-60"></a><span class="tm">19:14:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;danielbeck&gt;</span> yes
<a name="l-61"></a><span class="tm">19:14:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">ogondza:</span> would you create stable-1.636 branch?
<a name="l-62"></a><span class="tm">19:14:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> <span class="topic">#topic </span><span class="topicline">Final review/adoption of Board Election Process Proposal</span>

<a name="l-67"></a><span class="tm">19:15:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">rtyler:</span> now I'm ready to move on
<a name="l-68"></a><span class="tm">19:15:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> as in ready for the next topic
<a name="l-69"></a><span class="tm">19:15:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> in the proposal what's different from last time can be seen: https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/pages/diffpagesbyversion.action?pageId=63930772&amp;selectedPageVersions=10&amp;selectedPageVersions=8
<a name="l-70"></a><span class="tm">19:16:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> basically fleshed out some more details from last meeting around resignation/interims and rules around corporate involvement
<a name="l-71"></a><span class="tm">19:16:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> I know that orrc, teilo, fred02 and oleg-nenashev had some feedback

<a name="l-75"></a><span class="tm">19:18:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> Looks good to me. I'm ready to cast +1
<a name="l-76"></a><span class="tm">19:19:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;danielbeck&gt;</span> rtyler Since there are 5 seats, KK is permanent, and max of 2 candidates per company, will this result in CloudBees possibly getting 3/5 (KK + 2 candidates)?
<a name="l-77"></a><span class="tm">19:19:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;KostyaSha&gt;</span> could somebody describe why permanent?
<a name="l-78"></a><span class="tm">19:19:23 </span><span class="nka">* batmat</span> <span class="ac">reads</span>
<a name="l-79"></a><span class="tm">19:19:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> I'd assume kohsuke counts as one of the CloudBees seats.
<a name="l-80"></a><span class="tm">19:19:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;batmat&gt;</span> same question as danielbeck
<a name="l-81"></a><span class="tm">19:19:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">abayer:</span> my understanding as well
<a name="l-82"></a><span class="tm">19:19:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> that was my presumption as well, but should probably be clarified
<a name="l-83"></a><span class="tm">19:19:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;danielbeck&gt;</span> abayer Then make that clear. Right now it's not.
<a name="l-84"></a><span class="tm">19:20:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;danielbeck&gt;</span> as I wouldn't consider the one fixed member a "candidate" in the voting process.
<a name="l-85"></a><span class="tm">19:20:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> Good point.
<a name="l-86"></a><span class="tm">19:20:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> <span class="hi">KostyaSha:</span> for the same reason Guido van Rossum or Matz occupies such a position in the Python and Ruby communities
<a name="l-87"></a><span class="tm">19:20:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> <span class="hi">abayer:</span> will you update plz
<a name="l-88"></a><span class="tm">19:20:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;batmat&gt;</span> +1, let's not keep it ambiguous
<a name="l-89"></a><span class="tm">19:20:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> <span class="hi">rtyler:</span> Yeah, action item at me?
<a name="l-90"></a><span class="tm">19:20:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> update it right now you weenie
<a name="l-91"></a><span class="tm">19:20:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> I need to think about how to word it.
<a name="l-92"></a><span class="tm">19:20:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> I want to get this stamped
<a name="l-93"></a><span class="tm">19:20:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> sigh.
<a name="l-94"></a><span class="tm">19:20:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> Ok.
<a name="l-95"></a><span class="tm">19:20:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;KostyaSha&gt;</span> rtyler, in many projects creators left, in many projects creators locked development and projects was forked.
<a name="l-96"></a><span class="tm">19:20:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> we can edit it right here if that's the only concern
<a name="l-97"></a><span class="tm">19:20:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> Move on and circle back, then. =)
<a name="l-98"></a><span class="tm">19:21:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> <span class="hi">KostyaSha:</span> the phrasing is deliberate in that regard, "until such time he decides to resign"
<a name="l-99"></a><span class="tm">19:21:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;orrc&gt;</span> "regualrly" isn't a word, but I read the diff earlier and it seems good
<a name="l-100"></a><span class="tm">19:21:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;orrc&gt;</span> :)
<a name="l-101"></a><span class="tm">19:21:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> heh
<a name="l-102"></a><span class="tm">19:21:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> <span class="hi">orrc:</span> tidying this up may have been the first thing I did this morning
<a name="l-103"></a><span class="tm">19:21:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;KostyaSha&gt;</span> kohsuke, do you insist in your permanent place?
<a name="l-104"></a><span class="tm">19:22:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> I'd like to think that doing so ensures some degree of consistency, which is in the interest of the community.
<a name="l-105"></a><span class="tm">19:22:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> <span class="hi">KostyaSha:</span> this was already discussed in the previous meeting, I think it is important that kohsuke's place as the founder/leader of the project is codified in this proposal
<a name="l-106"></a><span class="tm">19:22:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/pages/diffpages.action?pageId=63930772&amp;originalId=85590498
<a name="l-107"></a><span class="tm">19:23:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;KostyaSha&gt;</span> rtyler, that shouldn't be a problem if he will have enough votes. Worst indicator will be if he didn't get enough votes.
<a name="l-108"></a><span class="tm">19:23:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> I made it generic so that it's not broken if we for some reason add another permanent seat in the future.
<a name="l-109"></a><span class="tm">19:24:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;batmat&gt;</span> +1 for well, not, I won't write the triple K this time, but +1 again for kohsuke as it's stated
<a name="l-110"></a><span class="tm">19:24:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> <span class="hi">abayer:</span> the edit looks fine to me
<a name="l-111"></a><span class="tm">19:24:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> <span class="hi">rtyler:</span> cool cool
<a name="l-112"></a><span class="tm">19:24:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;danielbeck&gt;</span> KostyaSha Except if too many people don't vote for KK because nobody thinks he could possibly be gone
<a name="l-113"></a><span class="tm">19:25:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;KostyaSha&gt;</span> danielbeck, rules of voting should be clear for all voters, right?
<a name="l-114"></a><span class="tm">19:25:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> IMO it's not the Jenkins project without kohsuke the same way it's not Linux without Linus
<a name="l-115"></a><span class="tm">19:25:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> Let's be blunt - the only real impact this will have is to simplify voting and vote calculations, since we won't always have Kohsuke votes to count.
<a name="l-116"></a><span class="tm">19:25:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> The end result will be identical.
<a name="l-117"></a><span class="tm">19:25:56 </span><span class="nka">* rtyler</span> <span class="ac">pokes hare_brain</span>
<a name="l-118"></a><span class="tm">19:26:14 </span><span class="nka">* hare_brain</span> <span class="ac">has been trying to get a sentence in edgewise.</span>
<a name="l-119"></a><span class="tm">19:26:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> heh
<a name="l-120"></a><span class="tm">19:26:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> just making sure I didn't need to make a wake-up call to your cell phone xD
<a name="l-121"></a><span class="tm">19:26:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;batmat&gt;</span> <span class="hi">abayer:</span> +1. And if you wish KostyaSha get elected to the board and make that the subject of the board next year or so.
<a name="l-122"></a><span class="tm">19:26:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;KostyaSha&gt;</span> ok, can i then name this position as king?
<a name="l-123"></a><span class="tm">19:27:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;KostyaSha&gt;</span> (for my personal usage)
<a name="l-124"></a><span class="tm">19:27:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> you can call it whatever you want KostyaSha
<a name="l-125"></a><span class="tm">19:27:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;KostyaSha&gt;</span> thanks!
<a name="l-126"></a><span class="tm">19:27:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> I agree with the proposal. I think Kohsuke's permanent position should not be up for discussion. We have to allow for his creatorship and leadership.

<a name="l-281"></a><span class="tm">19:59:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;danielbeck&gt;</span> KostyaSha Technical criticism is always valid. "Daniel is incompetent and Kohsuke doesn't give a shit" is not.
<a name="l-282"></a><span class="tm">20:00:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;danielbeck&gt;</span> KostyaSha So if you're saying "This feature is weird/the plugin cannot do X because it's not supported in Jenkins core/it's a long standing bug" nothing wrong with that.

<a name="l-286"></a><span class="tm">20:01:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;orrc&gt;</span> then it lists a ton of things that plugin/repo maintainers should be able to do
