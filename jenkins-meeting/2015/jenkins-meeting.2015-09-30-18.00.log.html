<a name="l-45"></a><span class="tm">18:07:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> I swear to god that I did produce &amp; posted RC binaries
<a name="l-46"></a><span class="tm">18:07:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> So I need to chase down where the lapse is in automation
<a name="l-47"></a><span class="tm">18:07:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;danielbeck&gt;</span> no announcement to the list
<a name="l-48"></a><span class="tm">18:07:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;danielbeck&gt;</span> http://mirrors.jenkins-ci.org/war-stable-rc/1.625.1/
<a name="l-49"></a><span class="tm">18:07:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;danielbeck&gt;</span> and no wiki page for RC testing
<a name="l-50"></a><span class="tm">18:08:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> Right, no announcement to the list was my fault
<a name="l-51"></a><span class="tm">18:08:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ogondza&gt;</span> I completely lost track, my apology
<a name="l-52"></a><span class="tm">18:08:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> oh I see, it didn't hit mirrors
<a name="l-53"></a><span class="tm">18:08:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ogondza&gt;</span> anyway, we are ready
<a name="l-54"></a><span class="tm">18:08:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> I see that the calendar was adjusted already to mark today as 1.625.1 RC date
<a name="l-55"></a><span class="tm">18:08:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;danielbeck&gt;</span> yep, I did that yesterday when we noticed
<a name="l-56"></a><span class="tm">18:08:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ogondza&gt;</span> I have backported one more issue and the revert what KostyaSha asked for

<a name="l-58"></a><span class="tm">18:09:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> OK, then I should build 1.625.1 RC2 then
<a name="l-59"></a><span class="tm">18:09:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;oleg-nenashev&gt;</span> Do we merge any security stuff into 1.625.1 ?
<a name="l-60"></a><span class="tm">18:10:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;danielbeck&gt;</span> I think .2 is better in general for security unless it's urgent?
<a name="l-61"></a><span class="tm">18:10:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;oleg-nenashev&gt;</span> +1
<a name="l-62"></a><span class="tm">18:10:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">oleg-nenashev:</span> historically, I believe we've done that right before the release, which means fixes skip RC soak tests
<a name="l-63"></a><span class="tm">18:10:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> I remember having that discussion with jglick when we started doing it
<a name="l-64"></a><span class="tm">18:11:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;danielbeck&gt;</span> with the exception of the master/slave system
<a name="l-65"></a><span class="tm">18:11:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;oleg-nenashev&gt;</span> <span class="hi">kohsuke:</span> I just want to make sure, because several PRs have been merged. I also vote for .2, but we need to make sure that the current fixes won't be taken into the release by the release bot
<a name="l-66"></a><span class="tm">18:12:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> Is it better to have this conversation in jenkinsci-cert list?
<a name="l-67"></a><span class="tm">18:12:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> I don't want to get too specific here about undisclosed issues or fixes we are planning to release in 1.625.1 if any.
<a name="l-68"></a><span class="tm">18:12:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jglick&gt;</span> Yes we can take this to jenkinsci-cert.
<a name="l-69"></a><span class="tm">18:12:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;oleg-nenashev&gt;</span> agreed
<a name="l-70"></a><span class="tm">18:12:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ogondza&gt;</span> ack, this is a process change
<a name="l-71"></a><span class="tm">18:13:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">ogondza:</span> is what I just described a process change from what we've been doing? I was trying to explain the current process.
<a name="l-72"></a><span class="tm">18:13:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;danielbeck&gt;</span> So we're done with LTS discussion? KK will post RC 2 and make sure it gets distributed correctly.
<a name="l-73"></a><span class="tm">18:13:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> Yes

<a name="l-75"></a><span class="tm">18:14:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;danielbeck&gt;</span> ... and announce it
<a name="l-76"></a><span class="tm">18:14:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ogondza&gt;</span> No, though preferring .2 for security fixes was proposed several times though not sure if sainted on meeting so I assume it is not a process
<a name="l-77"></a><span class="tm">18:14:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ogondza&gt;</span> <span class="hi">kohsuke:</span> ^

<a name="l-113"></a><span class="tm">18:22:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> We should announce that more formally too
<a name="l-114"></a><span class="tm">18:23:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;batmat&gt;</span> Ok, updated the page, is is OK now?
<a name="l-115"></a><span class="tm">18:24:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;oleg-nenashev&gt;</span> "Any company must have &lt;50% of board members" seems to be a reasonable addition

<a name="l-117"></a><span class="tm">18:24:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> I'm not sure it does though
<a name="l-118"></a><span class="tm">18:24:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">oleg-nenashev:</span> orrc: I wanted to actually discuss if it's so inherently bad that CB employees have majority
<a name="l-119"></a><span class="tm">18:24:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;KostyaSha&gt;</span> it also seems to me that now nobody from board really uses/supports jenkins for some projects
<a name="l-120"></a><span class="tm">18:25:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> kohsuke's clearly involved with how CB policy is made
<a name="l-121"></a><span class="tm">18:25:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;KostyaSha&gt;</span> * i mean practise
<a name="l-122"></a><span class="tm">18:25:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> but if you take somebody like danielbeck, I'm less convinced that his CB involvement "taints" his ability to act as a board member
<a name="l-123"></a><span class="tm">18:25:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> I think we should look to how something like Ubuntu is operated here
<a name="l-124"></a><span class="tm">18:26:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> or openSUSE
<a name="l-125"></a><span class="tm">18:26:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> KostyaSha, not sure what you mean
<a name="l-126"></a><span class="tm">18:26:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> if CB hires all the people who are passionate and spend lots of time on jenkins, we can't just *not* have a board
<a name="l-127"></a><span class="tm">18:26:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;oleg-nenashev&gt;</span> <span class="hi">kohsuke:</span> I think that it's pretty important. It will prevent formal complains that a company may dominate in the community and push any decision
<a name="l-128"></a><span class="tm">18:26:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> I guess my concern is that people who are getting stuff done, like danielbeck, gets necessary authority to act.

<a name="l-195"></a><span class="tm">18:38:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> then "looks shady" can be used as a weapon against the board in the future

<a name="l-197"></a><span class="tm">18:39:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mmars&gt;</span> <span class="hi">rtyler:</span> then there should be a disclosure policy and recusal in event of conflict of interest
<a name="l-198"></a><span class="tm">18:39:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> As I said, my concern in having the proposed rule is that it excludes lots of people who can spend time on the project, which is somewhat anti-meritocratic

<a name="l-200"></a><span class="tm">18:40:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> So if we are to adopt the proposed rule, I want us to spend some time thinking about it.
<a name="l-201"></a><span class="tm">18:40:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;oleg-nenashev&gt;</span> <span class="hi">kohsuke:</span> IIRC Jenkins contribution does not require the board membership
<a name="l-202"></a><span class="tm">18:40:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> so let's say danielbeck's job description is "work on Jenkins FOSS full time", does that present a conflict of interest?
<a name="l-203"></a><span class="tm">18:40:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;fredg02&gt;</span> <span class="hi">@kohsuke:</span> so you think we run out of candidates if we enforce the &lt;50% ruleß

<a name="l-205"></a><span class="tm">18:40:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> kohsuke as a CB investor and executive obviously *does* have a conflict of interest

<a name="l-207"></a><span class="tm">18:41:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;fredg02&gt;</span> <span class="hi">@rtyler:</span> yes, but it's ok as long as he does not have majority
<a name="l-208"></a><span class="tm">18:41:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> e.g., talking to SPI, ffis, or driving code of conduct investigation
<a name="l-209"></a><span class="tm">18:41:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> It seems there is a question of scope of the governance board. For example, the board has nothing to do with workflow as a feature of Jenkins, other than overlapping people.
<a name="l-210"></a><span class="tm">18:41:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;oleg-nenashev&gt;</span> It's just a "Board of Directors", which gives advices and acts as arbitrator. That's why it's important to keep it independent from both formal and informal POVs
<a name="l-211"></a><span class="tm">18:42:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">fredg02:</span> I wouldn't say we run out of candidates, but the pool will be smaller for sure
<a name="l-212"></a><span class="tm">18:42:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> I actually think that could potentially have the opposite effect
<a name="l-213"></a><span class="tm">18:42:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;fredg02&gt;</span> <span class="hi">@kohsuke:</span> but that's the lesser evil, I think
<a name="l-214"></a><span class="tm">18:42:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> since now CB as a company would have an interest in putting a few candidates forward that are in their interests
<a name="l-215"></a><span class="tm">18:43:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> as opposed to people volunteering themselves

<a name="l-217"></a><span class="tm">18:43:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> anyways, I agree with your point about there being some overlapping issues here hare_brain

<a name="l-219"></a><span class="tm">18:45:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> so let's nail down some actions to take between here and the next meeting to get this moving forward

<a name="l-222"></a><span class="tm">18:45:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> IMO, the board should not be involved in deciding feature roadmap, technical decisions, things about Jenkins-as-a-product. It's scope should be Jenkins-as-a-community. I can pretty clearly separate the two concepts. Not sure if that's how people generally feel.
<a name="l-223"></a><span class="tm">18:45:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;oleg-nenashev&gt;</span> There's also a question raised by teilo in such case
