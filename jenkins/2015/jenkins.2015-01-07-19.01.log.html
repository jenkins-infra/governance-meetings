<a name="l-8"></a><span class="tm">19:02:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;alyssa_&gt;</span> it sure feels like it
<a name="l-9"></a><span class="tm">19:02:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> It has.
<a name="l-10"></a><span class="tm">19:03:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke_&gt;</span> But in this topic alyssa_  and I wanted to go over feedbacks from JUC bay area
<a name="l-11"></a><span class="tm">19:03:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke_&gt;</span> and get some thoughts jot down for what to change in this year

<a name="l-15"></a><span class="tm">19:03:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke_&gt;</span> <span class="hi">alyssa_:</span> do you have the hyperlink to the result?
<a name="l-16"></a><span class="tm">19:04:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tfennelly&gt;</span> <span class="hi">danielbeck:</span> I saw that Daniel, thanks... kinda working on a fix (in between other stuff)
<a name="l-17"></a><span class="tm">19:04:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tfennelly&gt;</span> <span class="hi">danielbeck:</span> pain in the ass
<a name="l-18"></a><span class="tm">19:04:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;alyssa_&gt;</span> we didn't get many survey takers but those who provided feedback was valuable for us to make improvements
<a name="l-19"></a><span class="tm">19:04:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tfennelly&gt;</span> <span class="hi">danielbeck:</span> thanks for flagging it to me
<a name="l-20"></a><span class="tm">19:04:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;alyssa_&gt;</span> hold on let me get it
<a name="l-21"></a><span class="tm">19:05:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;alyssa_&gt;</span> https://docs.google.com/a/cloudbees.com/forms/d/1tRerFOUu4tOFG1KjmYENVZuXdLAc6r79Wl-qh36K5Bc/viewanalytics
<a name="l-22"></a><span class="tm">19:05:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;alyssa_&gt;</span> can everyone see this?
<a name="l-23"></a><span class="tm">19:06:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke_&gt;</span> Looks like it needs authentication
<a name="l-24"></a><span class="tm">19:06:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> And I seem to have forgotten my password. :/
<a name="l-25"></a><span class="tm">19:07:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;alyssa_&gt;</span> how about this https://docs.google.com/a/cloudbees.com/forms/d/1tRerFOUu4tOFG1KjmYENVZuXdLAc6r79Wl-qh36K5Bc/edit#
<a name="l-26"></a><span class="tm">19:08:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke_&gt;</span> I uploaded it to http://kohsuke.org/jucsf-feedback.pdf
<a name="l-27"></a><span class="tm">19:09:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke_&gt;</span> Just going through from the top...
<a name="l-28"></a><span class="tm">19:09:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> I can see it from Alyssa’s link.
<a name="l-29"></a><span class="tm">19:09:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke_&gt;</span> I only see the form in that link from alyssa_ but not the result page
<a name="l-30"></a><span class="tm">19:09:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke_&gt;</span> My PDF should be world readable
<a name="l-31"></a><span class="tm">19:10:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke_&gt;</span> "Which talk did you like the most, and why?"
<a name="l-32"></a><span class="tm">19:10:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke_&gt;</span> People listing lots of different ones and I'm not sure what the lesson should be here
<a name="l-33"></a><span class="tm">19:11:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke_&gt;</span> "Which talk did you not like the most, and why?"
<a name="l-34"></a><span class="tm">19:11:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;alyssa_&gt;</span> perhaps we can give synopsis of the result ?
<a name="l-35"></a><span class="tm">19:12:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke_&gt;</span> sure alyssa_ , why don't you take it
<a name="l-36"></a><span class="tm">19:12:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;alyssa_&gt;</span> JUC post-mortem Drunk on the code needs some improvements. People love the idea KK: it’d take too much prep work for Christou to do a proper “training”. Maybe position this more as a chaotic peer-to-peer mentoring activities ala “ask the experts”  Explicitly show the target audience level for talks: advanced, introductory, … Vet speakers on their presentation ability a bit more -&gt; by asking more questions during the sub
<a name="l-37"></a><span class="tm">19:13:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;alyssa_&gt;</span> sorry. this would looked nicer w/ bullet points
<a name="l-38"></a><span class="tm">19:13:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> The other thing I had mentioned to Alyssa during JUC is for those of us that reviewed the talk submissions, we should go over how we ranked the talks, and compare it to how the talks were received.
<a name="l-39"></a><span class="tm">19:13:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;pythys&gt;</span> Hi everyone! After an upgrade of jenkins (I think from 1.515 to 1.595) the builds are significantly slower (double time on everything). Is this normal? Do newer versions require more hardware resources?
<a name="l-40"></a><span class="tm">19:14:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke_&gt;</span> Yeah, it's useful to compare how I rated the talk vs how people rated the talk
<a name="l-41"></a><span class="tm">19:14:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;alyssa_&gt;</span> I can make notes on the spreadsheet as well w/ feedback from the survey
<a name="l-42"></a><span class="tm">19:15:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke_&gt;</span> Looking at why people didn't like talks, it seems predominantly about the preparation and delivery
<a name="l-43"></a><span class="tm">19:15:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;alyssa_&gt;</span> ok. i will send out reminder email for post mortem review of the sessions from voters
<a name="l-44"></a><span class="tm">19:15:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke_&gt;</span> ... as opposed to "this talk wasn't relevant"
<a name="l-45"></a><span class="tm">19:16:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke_&gt;</span> Nah, I guess people just didn't go to talks that are irrelevant, so they have no reasons to dislike them
<a name="l-46"></a><span class="tm">19:16:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> Maybe that’s something we should ask on submission forms in the future: How much experience have you had with public speaking?
<a name="l-47"></a><span class="tm">19:16:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;alyssa_&gt;</span> KK do mean perhaps we'd want more experienced speakers?
<a name="l-48"></a><span class="tm">19:17:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke_&gt;</span> <span class="hi">hare_brain:</span> +1. Checking more on whether they are good speakers,
<a name="l-49"></a><span class="tm">19:17:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke_&gt;</span> "What kind of talk did you want to hear that you did not hear?"
<a name="l-50"></a><span class="tm">19:17:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> This might be going too far, but asking for a draft of their presentation before the conference, so we can get a sense of what it’s going to be like?
<a name="l-51"></a><span class="tm">19:18:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> To sort of sanity check that the presentation is what we expected when we reviewed their submission?
<a name="l-52"></a><span class="tm">19:18:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;alyssa_&gt;</span> we did this but the issue was no one has the bandwidth to check
<a name="l-53"></a><span class="tm">19:18:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke_&gt;</span> JavaOne certainly does that
<a name="l-54"></a><span class="tm">19:19:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> Yeah, that’s why I said it might be going too far.
<a name="l-55"></a><span class="tm">19:19:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke_&gt;</span> I think hare_brain is thinking more about asking that at the time of submission
<a name="l-56"></a><span class="tm">19:19:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;alyssa_&gt;</span> those on the OC does receive a few pptx from speakers prior to event.
<a name="l-57"></a><span class="tm">19:19:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> I didn’t have a particular time in mind, other than “far enough ahead of the conference for the presenter to make changes”
<a name="l-58"></a><span class="tm">19:20:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> Or for the OC to swap talks.
<a name="l-59"></a><span class="tm">19:20:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;alyssa_&gt;</span> we do ask for it during the acceptance process
<a name="l-60"></a><span class="tm">19:21:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke_&gt;</span> Shall we move on to the next "What kind of talk did you want to hear that you did not hear?" question?
<a name="l-61"></a><span class="tm">19:21:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> With respect to that, the answers seem to be all over the map.
<a name="l-62"></a><span class="tm">19:21:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;alyssa_&gt;</span> sure
<a name="l-63"></a><span class="tm">19:21:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke_&gt;</span> I see more people asking for details and best practices
<a name="l-64"></a><span class="tm">19:21:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> But I think that we can use it to suggest themes for topics for this year’s submissions.
<a name="l-65"></a><span class="tm">19:21:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke_&gt;</span> A couple of comments about more basic introductory stuff
<a name="l-66"></a><span class="tm">19:22:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;danielbeck&gt;</span> pythys Meeting ongoing, please wait a bit. Should be finished in half an hour or so.
<a name="l-67"></a><span class="tm">19:22:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke_&gt;</span> More comment about plugin dev room
<a name="l-68"></a><span class="tm">19:22:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;pythys&gt;</span> <span class="hi">danielbeck:</span> thank you
<a name="l-69"></a><span class="tm">19:22:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke_&gt;</span> I think that plugin dev room was a victim of its success
<a name="l-70"></a><span class="tm">19:23:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke_&gt;</span> Between that and the success of "ask the experts", I feel like that part of the event could be beefed up
<a name="l-71"></a><span class="tm">19:23:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;alyssa_&gt;</span> from this we will have perhaps 3 levels: Intro, Interm, adv
<a name="l-72"></a><span class="tm">19:24:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> Was there feedback about ask the experts? I didn’t see any.
<a name="l-73"></a><span class="tm">19:24:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke_&gt;</span> <span class="hi">alyssa_:</span> right, that subject familiarity indicator would be useful
<a name="l-74"></a><span class="tm">19:24:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke_&gt;</span> <span class="hi">hare_brain:</span> not in this form indeed, but I felt it was very lively
<a name="l-75"></a><span class="tm">19:24:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;alyssa_&gt;</span> i don't think so but we saw how successful that was at the event
<a name="l-76"></a><span class="tm">19:25:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> Do we need more experts next time?
<a name="l-77"></a><span class="tm">19:25:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke_&gt;</span> If we can get more, sure
<a name="l-78"></a><span class="tm">19:25:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke_&gt;</span> But I liked the earlier part of that where we had a whole room
<a name="l-79"></a><span class="tm">19:26:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;alyssa_&gt;</span> i liked the numbers we had this time but could welcome more :)
<a name="l-80"></a><span class="tm">19:26:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke_&gt;</span> There was no "the expert side of the table" vs "the attendd side of the table" distinction
<a name="l-81"></a><span class="tm">19:26:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke_&gt;</span> It's more of a room full of good conversations
<a name="l-82"></a><span class="tm">19:26:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> Yeah.
<a name="l-83"></a><span class="tm">19:27:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke_&gt;</span> Maybe it was just a matter of having more space
<a name="l-84"></a><span class="tm">19:27:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;alyssa_&gt;</span> I was at AWS and their Ask the Experts was not as crowded as ours :)
<a name="l-85"></a><span class="tm">19:27:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;alyssa_&gt;</span> will def have more space next time
<a name="l-86"></a><span class="tm">19:28:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> I think the key thing I realized about our Ask the Experts was to plan for multiple conversations in parallel. It was really hard for me to hold my conversation, sometimes, because of another conversation close by.
<a name="l-87"></a><span class="tm">19:28:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;autojack&gt;</span> hi, just joining...
<a name="l-88"></a><span class="tm">19:28:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke_&gt;</span> would more space help?
<a name="l-89"></a><span class="tm">19:28:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke_&gt;</span> I'd think it helps keep distances between two conversations
<a name="l-90"></a><span class="tm">19:28:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> Yes!
<a name="l-91"></a><span class="tm">19:28:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;alyssa_&gt;</span> would spreading out help ?
<a name="l-92"></a><span class="tm">19:29:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke_&gt;</span> The reason I keep bringing "plugin dev room" in this same conversation is because I think it shouldn't feel like a teacher-led training and more like the ask-the-experts conversations
<a name="l-93"></a><span class="tm">19:29:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> I think that makes sense.
<a name="l-94"></a><span class="tm">19:29:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke_&gt;</span> It could be people bringing out their computers around a round table as a conversation just like we'd bring out papers &amp; pencils
<a name="l-95"></a><span class="tm">19:30:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke_&gt;</span> That way Steven wouldn't have to feel like he needs to address the whole audience and keep them hurded
<a name="l-96"></a><span class="tm">19:30:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> Wifi probably needs to be better for that.
<a name="l-97"></a><span class="tm">19:30:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> The hotel wifi *was* awful.
<a name="l-98"></a><span class="tm">19:30:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke_&gt;</span> You just can't have a instructor led training with one guy teaching 30 people
<a name="l-99"></a><span class="tm">19:30:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;alyssa_&gt;</span> <span class="hi">hare_brain:</span> for sure
<a name="l-100"></a><span class="tm">19:31:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;autojack&gt;</span> on the topic of people wanting to hear more tips and best practices talks... I wonder if could organize and curate that as its own track, and possibly give it one of the bigger/biggest rooms.
<a name="l-101"></a><span class="tm">19:31:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke_&gt;</span> Local maven proxy was my suggestion but he didn't time to get that prepared
<a name="l-102"></a><span class="tm">19:31:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;autojack&gt;</span> personally I find those talks, aimed at a general audience, to be more useful to me than the case studies and so on.
<a name="l-103"></a><span class="tm">19:31:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;alyssa_&gt;</span> <span class="hi">hare_brain:</span> the hotel had an earful from me wrt wifi. they apologized and didn't charge us a penny for it
<a name="l-104"></a><span class="tm">19:32:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;autojack&gt;</span> conference wifi is hard :/
<a name="l-105"></a><span class="tm">19:32:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke_&gt;</span> <span class="hi">autojack:</span> yeah, we should call out for best practices specifically and encourage submissions in that space.
<a name="l-106"></a><span class="tm">19:32:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke_&gt;</span> Whether we can neatly pack it to one track I'm not too sure, but if the agenda marks such talks as such, then that's a great improvement.
<a name="l-107"></a><span class="tm">19:33:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;autojack&gt;</span> agreed.
<a name="l-108"></a><span class="tm">19:33:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> abayer was a rock star, apparently. ;)
<a name="l-109"></a><span class="tm">19:34:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke_&gt;</span> "If we add another day of unconference after JUC, would you come?"
<a name="l-110"></a><span class="tm">19:34:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;alyssa_&gt;</span> abayer was a rock star globally: Boston, Berlin, and SF
<a name="l-111"></a><span class="tm">19:34:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke_&gt;</span> Not sure what to take from that one
<a name="l-112"></a><span class="tm">19:35:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> Maybe we can have some sort of “Best of Show” award for the best talk, to incentivize better talks?
<a name="l-113"></a><span class="tm">19:35:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> abayer is not eligible. ;)
<a name="l-114"></a><span class="tm">19:35:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke_&gt;</span> Copenhagen people told me that that part of the event is the most polarizing --- some people love it and other people hate it
<a name="l-115"></a><span class="tm">19:36:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke_&gt;</span> wrt "best of show" I think alyssa_ would love that as it lets her pimp up JUC more
<a name="l-116"></a><span class="tm">19:36:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;alyssa_&gt;</span> :)
<a name="l-117"></a><span class="tm">19:36:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;alyssa_&gt;</span> but i would need more involvement from the OC :)
<a name="l-118"></a><span class="tm">19:36:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> I have this image of Mr. Jenkins all blinged out.
<a name="l-119"></a><span class="tm">19:37:23 </span><span class="nka">* kohsuke_</span> <span class="ac">looks up a dictionary</span>
<a name="l-120"></a><span class="tm">19:37:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;alyssa_&gt;</span> <span class="hi">@hare_brain:</span> and a gold tooth too ?
<a name="l-121"></a><span class="tm">19:37:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> That’s right!
<a name="l-122"></a><span class="tm">19:38:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke_&gt;</span> You didn't like the ninja &amp; knife outfit, huh

<a name="l-124"></a><span class="tm">19:38:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke_&gt;</span> "Privacy vs cost"
<a name="l-125"></a><span class="tm">19:38:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke_&gt;</span> ... which seems to be generally saying majority is OK with the sponsor / ticket price balance
<a name="l-126"></a><span class="tm">19:38:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> I think the results from that are good.
<a name="l-127"></a><span class="tm">19:39:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;danielbeck&gt;</span> <span class="hi">kohsuke_:</span> Those are also referenced in 'Any other thoughts' with extreme disagreement
<a name="l-128"></a><span class="tm">19:39:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> There were a couple of comments ...
<a name="l-129"></a><span class="tm">19:39:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;autojack&gt;</span> oh, one comment I'd like to throw out. I had a ticket but ended up not being able to make it, so then I was amused and a little annoyed that sponsors spammed the hell out of me, mostly including a comment that it was nice to meet me at JUC SF.
<a name="l-130"></a><span class="tm">19:39:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;danielbeck&gt;</span> item 5 + 6
<a name="l-131"></a><span class="tm">19:39:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> yeah, what danielbeck just said.
<a name="l-132"></a><span class="tm">19:39:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;autojack&gt;</span> heh
<a name="l-133"></a><span class="tm">19:39:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke_&gt;</span> <span class="hi">danielbeck:</span> indeed, all caps
<a name="l-134"></a><span class="tm">19:39:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> <span class="hi">autojack:</span> Yeah. I laughed at all the “nice to meet you” spam too.
<a name="l-135"></a><span class="tm">19:40:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke_&gt;</span> I just wonder how other events make the ends meet
<a name="l-136"></a><span class="tm">19:40:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> So I do think that it needs to be more prominent that this will happen.
<a name="l-137"></a><span class="tm">19:40:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;danielbeck&gt;</span> if it was like Berlin with every sponsor emailing me within three days, I can understand some of the hate
<a name="l-138"></a><span class="tm">19:40:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;autojack&gt;</span> I didn't take it too personally, I understand that we need sponsors and they want to talk to potential customers.
<a name="l-139"></a><span class="tm">19:40:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> But I think autojack’s comment about getting spammed when you didn’t even go is an easy thing to deal with at our scale.
<a name="l-140"></a><span class="tm">19:41:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke_&gt;</span> A number of people took this very badly, there were several flare ups in Twitter as well, and I got 2 or 3 e-mails from people about this.
<a name="l-141"></a><span class="tm">19:41:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;autojack&gt;</span> well, I actually thought my company refunded my ticket, but then I got all the spam so I presumed not.
<a name="l-142"></a><span class="tm">19:41:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;autojack&gt;</span> I never checked on that.
<a name="l-143"></a><span class="tm">19:41:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;autojack&gt;</span> it would be more funny if that was the case.
<a name="l-144"></a><span class="tm">19:41:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;autojack&gt;</span> (lucky for us I mostly thought it was funny)
<a name="l-145"></a><span class="tm">19:41:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> Well, you registered, so it was probably just the list of registrants that got handed out.
<a name="l-146"></a><span class="tm">19:42:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;autojack&gt;</span> makes sense.
<a name="l-147"></a><span class="tm">19:42:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke_&gt;</span> Is badge scanning still an option to be explored?
<a name="l-148"></a><span class="tm">19:43:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;alyssa_&gt;</span> <span class="hi">kohsuke_:</span> we will definitely have badge scanning in 2015
<a name="l-149"></a><span class="tm">19:44:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke_&gt;</span> I'm hoping that limiting mailing to people who have been scanned would help
<a name="l-150"></a><span class="tm">19:44:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> I also wonder if there’s some sort of windowing that can be done on the after-event marketing emails. It might not be so bad if people weren’t inundated all at once by these companies. It did feel a bit like being mobbed.
<a name="l-151"></a><span class="tm">19:45:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke_&gt;</span> Back to PDF, then we have a long list of which talks got good scores...
<a name="l-152"></a><span class="tm">19:45:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;alyssa_&gt;</span> <span class="hi">@hare_brain:</span> I could definitely bring this up
<a name="l-153"></a><span class="tm">19:45:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;danielbeck&gt;</span> hare_brain This.
<a name="l-154"></a><span class="tm">19:45:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> <span class="hi">alyssa_:</span> I was AFK, but FYI I was not actually at Boston. =)
<a name="l-155"></a><span class="tm">19:45:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke_&gt;</span> Oh I see, so you don't give them all at once to everyone and stagger them?
<a name="l-156"></a><span class="tm">19:46:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke_&gt;</span> So it comes in trickles?
<a name="l-157"></a><span class="tm">19:46:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;alyssa_&gt;</span> <span class="hi">@abayer:</span> you would have been a rock star there too :)
<a name="l-158"></a><span class="tm">19:46:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> =)
<a name="l-159"></a><span class="tm">19:46:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> kohsuke_ yeah
<a name="l-160"></a><span class="tm">19:46:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke_&gt;</span> <span class="hi">alyssa_:</span> that seems like a relatively easy thing to do that would help
<a name="l-161"></a><span class="tm">19:47:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke_&gt;</span> ""Hiding in Plain Sight: Unmasking the Jenkins DSL" is getting good attendance and great score, too
<a name="l-162"></a><span class="tm">19:48:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;alyssa_&gt;</span> <span class="hi">kohsuke_:</span> sorry specifically what would be easy thing to do?
<a name="l-163"></a><span class="tm">19:48:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke_&gt;</span> "How to Train Jenkins?…to Use Your Resources Effectively and Get More Value for Each Buck Spent on Resources" :-(
<a name="l-164"></a><span class="tm">19:48:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;autojack&gt;</span> it seems like we should brainstorm some different ways to add value for sponsors rather than giving them 500 email addresses.
<a name="l-165"></a><span class="tm">19:48:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke_&gt;</span> <span class="hi">alyssa_:</span> when you hand over the attendee contact information to sponsors, don't do that all at once but spread that over time
<a name="l-166"></a><span class="tm">19:49:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke_&gt;</span> <span class="hi">autojack:</span> do you have some suggestions?
<a name="l-167"></a><span class="tm">19:49:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;alyssa_&gt;</span> <span class="hi">kohsuke_:</span> it would be easy but i think they hound lisa for it like right after the show
<a name="l-168"></a><span class="tm">19:49:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;autojack&gt;</span> <span class="hi">kohsuke_:</span> I'm thinking... that's why I said branstorm ;)
<a name="l-169"></a><span class="tm">19:49:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;autojack&gt;</span> hmm
<a name="l-170"></a><span class="tm">19:49:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke_&gt;</span> "Workflow in Jenkins" did pretty good score-wise too
<a name="l-171"></a><span class="tm">19:50:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;autojack&gt;</span> I mean, if we think about it from a sponsor point of view, they want to engage with potential leads right?
<a name="l-172"></a><span class="tm">19:50:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;autojack&gt;</span> (or, in my company's case in 2013, recruit people ;)
<a name="l-173"></a><span class="tm">19:50:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke_&gt;</span> Yes
<a name="l-174"></a><span class="tm">19:51:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;autojack&gt;</span> so I wonder how else we could let them engage with leads more effectively than just giving them a table.
<a name="l-175"></a><span class="tm">19:51:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke_&gt;</span> <span class="hi">ogondza:</span> I see your access request. You can see it from http://kohsuke.org/jucsf-feedback.pdf instead
<a name="l-176"></a><span class="tm">19:51:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;autojack&gt;</span> a group of sponsor showcase talks, advertised as such?
<a name="l-177"></a><span class="tm">19:51:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;autojack&gt;</span> interested parties can attend, or not.
<a name="l-178"></a><span class="tm">19:51:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke_&gt;</span> There was a lunch time session for that
<a name="l-179"></a><span class="tm">19:52:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;autojack&gt;</span> seems it would be more likely to give the sponsors only the interested attendees.
<a name="l-180"></a><span class="tm">19:52:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;autojack&gt;</span> but they may not see it that way.
<a name="l-181"></a><span class="tm">19:52:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke_&gt;</span> And of course higher tier sponsors got their talking slots
<a name="l-182"></a><span class="tm">19:52:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;autojack&gt;</span> nod.
<a name="l-183"></a><span class="tm">19:52:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke_&gt;</span> If we can combine that lunch time talk with badge scanning
<a name="l-184"></a><span class="tm">19:52:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke_&gt;</span> Maybe that'd make the opportunity more attractive
<a name="l-185"></a><span class="tm">19:52:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;autojack&gt;</span> yeah, although I fear that almost no one would scan their badge.
<a name="l-186"></a><span class="tm">19:52:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke_&gt;</span> That is, if they get to contact those who came to their talks...
<a name="l-187"></a><span class="tm">19:53:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;autojack&gt;</span> it almost sounds like SWIPE HERE TO RECEIVE SPAM
<a name="l-188"></a><span class="tm">19:53:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke_&gt;</span> :-)
<a name="l-189"></a><span class="tm">19:53:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;alyssa_&gt;</span> that's what we did tho. sponsor lunch time talk and they scanned attendees or took down names
<a name="l-190"></a><span class="tm">19:53:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;autojack&gt;</span> but I guess it's fair, it's opt in.
<a name="l-191"></a><span class="tm">19:53:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;autojack&gt;</span> yeah my apologies for commenting given that I did not actually attend.
<a name="l-192"></a><span class="tm">19:53:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke_&gt;</span> How about dedicated exhibit time?
<a name="l-193"></a><span class="tm">19:54:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke_&gt;</span> In some other events, those are the time that booths get really busy, and it helps me feel like our presence (as a vendor) was worth it
<a name="l-194"></a><span class="tm">19:54:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke_&gt;</span> (just trying to brainstorm here)
<a name="l-195"></a><span class="tm">19:54:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;alyssa_&gt;</span> we had dedicated exhibit time as well..about 1 hr in the afternoon
<a name="l-196"></a><span class="tm">19:54:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke_&gt;</span> oh
<a name="l-197"></a><span class="tm">19:55:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;alyssa_&gt;</span> while no session takes place
<a name="l-198"></a><span class="tm">19:55:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke_&gt;</span> Clearly you are way ahead of the game
<a name="l-199"></a><span class="tm">19:55:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;autojack&gt;</span> that sounds good if it works. I guess it also depends on what people expect to get out of the conf.
<a name="l-200"></a><span class="tm">19:55:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;autojack&gt;</span> as attendees.
<a name="l-201"></a><span class="tm">19:55:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;autojack&gt;</span> I would probably opt to use that time to read twitter ;)

<a name="l-205"></a><span class="tm">19:56:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;autojack&gt;</span> it just needs a little bit of tuning probably.
