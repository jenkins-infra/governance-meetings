<a name="l-9"></a><span class="tm">19:03:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> So I think the key thing I wanted to get the sense of other people is ...
<a name="l-10"></a><span class="tm">19:03:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hgilmore&gt;</span> I am proposing a date of Feb 24 as the "official" day - pending Kohsuke confirming that we actually reached 100K
<a name="l-11"></a><span class="tm">19:04:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> that it's OK for us to spend $150 or so for give-aways
<a name="l-12"></a><span class="tm">19:04:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">hgilmore:</span> yep, and it did come in http://stats.jenkins-ci.org/jenkins-stats/svg/total-jenkins.svg
<a name="l-13"></a><span class="tm">19:04:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> As of the end of 2015 Jan, we are 102,992
<a name="l-14"></a><span class="tm">19:04:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> So we did actually pass 100K. Hooray
<a name="l-15"></a><span class="tm">19:05:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hgilmore&gt;</span> Wahooo!! Great!
<a name="l-16"></a><span class="tm">19:06:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> The gist of the proposal is (1) call for a blog roll from people, (2) several prize to give-away for that,
<a name="l-17"></a><span class="tm">19:06:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> (3) we'll have some round table conversations somewhere in San Francisco with rtyler, abayer, hare_brain and whoever else could join
<a name="l-18"></a><span class="tm">19:07:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> (4) record that and publish that, then (5) go chase after some existing podcasts to see if they can let us talk 5 mins and point to this.
<a name="l-19"></a><span class="tm">19:08:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> hgilmore has some additional interests in creating more images that we can use for various purposes
<a name="l-20"></a><span class="tm">19:09:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> Any thoughts from anyone else?
<a name="l-21"></a><span class="tm">19:09:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hgilmore&gt;</span> I am offering to get some images created, to be shared amongst us and that we can have some fun with on social media. All in celebration of Jenkins
<a name="l-22"></a><span class="tm">19:10:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> All right, looks like nobody is here today :-(
<a name="l-23"></a><span class="tm">19:10:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> Perhaps my failing to set up the agenda upfront is a part of the problem
<a name="l-24"></a><span class="tm">19:11:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;oleg-nenashev&gt;</span> Were there any particular topics? // I've missed first 10 minutes Ж(

<a name="l-39"></a><span class="tm">19:13:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;oleg-nenashev&gt;</span> Seems it should be blacklisted

<a name="l-41"></a><span class="tm">19:16:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;oleg-nenashev&gt;</span> <span class="hi">kohsuke:</span> Regarding the bot: /mode #mychat +b javabot[@m027-124.nv.iinet.net.au]
<a name="l-42"></a><span class="tm">19:16:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> By “somewhere in San Francisco,” do you mean in the city, or were you thinking somewhere in the area?
<a name="l-43"></a><span class="tm">19:16:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ogondza&gt;</span> +1 for the proposal #1 on https://groups.google.com/d/msg/jenkinsci-users/_6YfPztJ924/G2rknTGr4gsJ
<a name="l-44"></a><span class="tm">19:17:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">hare_brain:</span> my plan was to find an evening that works for all of us, find a place in the city, and pick you up at your office and drive up to get that done
<a name="l-45"></a><span class="tm">19:17:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;xender&gt;</span> Hi. I have atypical problem - I want a single job invocation to report multiple statuses.
<a name="l-46"></a><span class="tm">19:17:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> failing that, I'll ask abayer and rtyler to be in one room, me and hare_brain in another room, and Google Hangout on Air to invite others.
<a name="l-47"></a><span class="tm">19:17:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;xender&gt;</span> To be more specific: I invoke a shell script from a job. That shell script does several sub-jobs and I want to have nice status indication of each in Jenkins
<a name="l-48"></a><span class="tm">19:18:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">xender:</span> we are in the project meeting time, so let's hold off questions until after that
<a name="l-49"></a><span class="tm">19:18:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;xender&gt;</span> No separate channel for devs for that? :P Okay, I'll wait
<a name="l-50"></a><span class="tm">19:19:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">hare_brain:</span> would either of this be a problem to you?
<a name="l-51"></a><span class="tm">19:19:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> I just need some advanced notice to coordinate with the family that I’ll be gone for that evening.
<a name="l-52"></a><span class="tm">19:20:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> Yes, and I have AI to use some tool to find a date that works for 4 of us
<a name="l-53"></a><span class="tm">19:20:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> (hoping there's a website that lets people enter which day works and which day doesn't)
<a name="l-54"></a><span class="tm">19:20:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">ogondza:</span> thanks for the +1
<a name="l-55"></a><span class="tm">19:20:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> Any other +1 / -1, etc?
<a name="l-56"></a><span class="tm">19:21:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;oleg-nenashev&gt;</span> +1
<a name="l-57"></a><span class="tm">19:22:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hgilmore&gt;</span> OK - so just two questions, since there haven't been a lot of comments on Jenkins at 100K
<a name="l-58"></a><span class="tm">19:22:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">xender:</span> btw your thoughts would be just as welcome
<a name="l-59"></a><span class="tm">19:23:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hgilmore&gt;</span> Is there any reason I should *not* follow up on my ideas/suggestions? I am willing to do them, but I need to know so I can get started.
<a name="l-60"></a><span class="tm">19:23:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hgilmore&gt;</span> And, are we all OK with a date of Feb 24 as the "official" day?
<a name="l-61"></a><span class="tm">19:24:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;xender&gt;</span> <span class="hi">kohsuke:</span> Sorry, I just joined the channel. And I'm not an experienced user, so I don't know if I can be any help?
<a name="l-62"></a><span class="tm">19:24:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> I think we've socialized the idea enough and we have enough +1s to consider this blessed
<a name="l-63"></a><span class="tm">19:24:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hgilmore&gt;</span> OK - thank you to all who have spoken up.
<a name="l-64"></a><span class="tm">19:25:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> Let me record that as such
<a name="l-65"></a><span class="tm">19:25:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hgilmore&gt;</span> This will be fun and we will celebrate a huge milestone for us and our favorite Butler!
<a name="l-66"></a><span class="tm">19:25:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> <span class="cmd">#agreed  </span><span class="cmdline">https://groups.google.com/d/msg/jenkinsci-users/_6YfPztJ924/G2rknTGr4gsJ is considered blessed</span>
<a name="l-67"></a><span class="tm">19:25:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> Oh and the date
<a name="l-68"></a><span class="tm">19:26:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> What needs to happen before that date?
<a name="l-69"></a><span class="tm">19:26:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> Is that the blog submission deadline?
<a name="l-70"></a><span class="tm">19:26:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> Or is that when we post the "Yay! 100K" news that include the announcement to start the blog fest?
<a name="l-71"></a><span class="tm">19:26:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hgilmore&gt;</span> (1) People can start blogging and talking up the date
<a name="l-72"></a><span class="tm">19:27:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hgilmore&gt;</span> (2) I will share images of the Butler/100K themes that we can all circulate
<a name="l-73"></a><span class="tm">19:28:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hgilmore&gt;</span> (3) On the day - depending on what you, hare_brain, rtyler and abayer work out, you will do the Hangout or post a recording celebrating/talking about Jenkins
<a name="l-74"></a><span class="tm">19:28:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hgilmore&gt;</span> We can also issue a press release (which I neglected to include in the Google Groups note) announcing the milestones for Jenkins
<a name="l-75"></a><span class="tm">19:29:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hgilmore&gt;</span> Would it be helpful if I post a summary in the Google Groups?
<a name="l-76"></a><span class="tm">19:29:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> OK, so I'm still confused as to what needs to happen before that date and what's supposed to happen on that date
<a name="l-77"></a><span class="tm">19:29:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> I guess (1) and (2) happen before the flag day, (3) and (4) happens on the flag day?
<a name="l-78"></a><span class="tm">19:29:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hgilmore&gt;</span> Before the date, the community should promote the blogfest and people shoudl be bogging and announcing Jenkins 100K day for 2/24
<a name="l-79"></a><span class="tm">19:30:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hgilmore&gt;</span> On the day, we can all use a special Twitter badge on our profiles, you guys either do a live recording or post a pre-recorded session, we issue a press release announcing the milestones
<a name="l-80"></a><span class="tm">19:30:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hgilmore&gt;</span> Yes
<a name="l-81"></a><span class="tm">19:31:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hgilmore&gt;</span> You are corrct
<a name="l-82"></a><span class="tm">19:31:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hgilmore&gt;</span> correct
<a name="l-83"></a><span class="tm">19:31:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> OK, I'm looking at the calendar and I'm feeling 2/24 is bit tight
<a name="l-84"></a><span class="tm">19:31:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hgilmore&gt;</span> I will pull together a summary schedule/outline with dates
<a name="l-85"></a><span class="tm">19:32:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> fwiw, I'm out of town from 3/4 through 3/15.
<a name="l-86"></a><span class="tm">19:32:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> Could we get like one more week? Or maybe the hangout can happen post Feb 24?
<a name="l-87"></a><span class="tm">19:32:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hgilmore&gt;</span> Do you have a preferred date? I was pushing it towards the end of the month for the same reason.
<a name="l-88"></a><span class="tm">19:32:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hgilmore&gt;</span> What is your preference?
<a name="l-89"></a><span class="tm">19:32:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">abayer:</span> do you really mean March or you mean Feb?
<a name="l-90"></a><span class="tm">19:32:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> March.
<a name="l-91"></a><span class="tm">19:32:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hgilmore&gt;</span> I think the hangout could happen post=Feb 24
<a name="l-92"></a><span class="tm">19:33:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hgilmore&gt;</span> It doesn't necessarily need to be pegged to the date
<a name="l-93"></a><span class="tm">19:34:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hgilmore&gt;</span> But it woudl be nice to have the date as close to the milestone being reached as we can pull off
<a name="l-94"></a><span class="tm">19:34:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">hgilmore:</span> so it'd be OK if on the flag day we don't have the winners and the post is like "we'll do a celebration hangout on such and such date so please come join us?"
<a name="l-95"></a><span class="tm">19:34:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> If it doesn’t happen within a week of 2/24, abayer’s schedule would push it out two more weeks past that.
<a name="l-96"></a><span class="tm">19:35:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">hare_brain:</span> abayer: I guess then I want to make it happen in the week of 2/16 or 2/23
<a name="l-97"></a><span class="tm">19:35:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> Sorry, got a niece due in early March so I'm back in Boston then. =)
<a name="l-98"></a><span class="tm">19:35:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hgilmore&gt;</span> Yes, we can make that work.
<a name="l-99"></a><span class="tm">19:35:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> OK, then Feb 24 it is
<a name="l-100"></a><span class="tm">19:35:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hgilmore&gt;</span> What is the concern for the 24th, since it sounds like things get complicated after that, scheduling-wise.
<a name="l-101"></a><span class="tm">19:35:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hgilmore&gt;</span> Jsut pulling together the hangout?
<a name="l-102"></a><span class="tm">19:36:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CptRageToaster&gt;</span> where is it?
<a name="l-103"></a><span class="tm">19:36:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> I'm away the week of Feb 9, and I'm away 21-23.
<a name="l-104"></a><span class="tm">19:36:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CptRageToaster&gt;</span> city/area-wise?
<a name="l-105"></a><span class="tm">19:37:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hgilmore&gt;</span> What if it was the 26?
<a name="l-106"></a><span class="tm">19:37:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">CptRageToaster:</span> most likely in San Francisco for meat bodies and Hang out for everyone else remote
<a name="l-107"></a><span class="tm">19:37:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hgilmore&gt;</span> Again, just trying to keep it close to the  milestone achievement date
<a name="l-108"></a><span class="tm">19:37:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> I mean Google Hangout
<a name="l-109"></a><span class="tm">19:37:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> 2/24 should be OK.
<a name="l-110"></a><span class="tm">19:37:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> for me
<a name="l-111"></a><span class="tm">19:37:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> Yeah, anytime before 3/4 is good for me.
<a name="l-112"></a><span class="tm">19:38:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> Feb 26 would give me some buffer if that's OK
<a name="l-113"></a><span class="tm">19:38:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> Fine by me.
<a name="l-114"></a><span class="tm">19:38:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> and we try to get the session going before to allow for post-production and blog post preparation
<a name="l-115"></a><span class="tm">19:38:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hgilmore&gt;</span> That totally works. How about hare_brain, abayer?
<a name="l-116"></a><span class="tm">19:39:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hgilmore&gt;</span> OK - Feb 26, then?
