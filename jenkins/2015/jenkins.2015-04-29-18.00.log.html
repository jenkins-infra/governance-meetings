<a name="l-88"></a><span class="tm">18:22:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> But it does set some expectation as to what's likely OK and what's not, which is good.

I think it’s still preferable to have the requests come in.

<a name="l-90"></a><span class="tm">18:22:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;teilo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">ogondza:</span> I would still think that there should be some approval and restrictions rather than an allow all so long as there is attribution (otherwise IANAL defeding the mark could become harder)

<a name="l-149"></a><span class="tm">18:36:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;danielbeck&gt;</span> It's a bit related to what I asked about in October (and still didn't act on) wrt. plugins developped outside Jenkins infra, using different issue tracker, etc.
<a name="l-150"></a><span class="tm">18:36:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;KostyaSha&gt;</span> kohsuke, all linux distros already resolved such problems many years ago
<a name="l-151"></a><span class="tm">18:36:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ogondza&gt;</span> <span class="hi">KostyaSha:</span> or the authors can host the other UC on their own
<a name="l-152"></a><span class="tm">18:36:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;orrc&gt;</span> I think that the UC is only for open source is clear. the question was more about closed source/commercial pages on the wiki?
<a name="l-153"></a><span class="tm">18:36:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">KostyaSha:</span> right, by letting them create their own UCs, and people can do the same with Jenkins today
<a name="l-154"></a><span class="tm">18:37:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;KostyaSha&gt;</span> ogondza, +1 the same as linux mirrors of any repo, but jenkins can provide hosting or so called "home" projects and provide better user friendly UC handling
<a name="l-155"></a><span class="tm">18:37:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">orrc:</span> oh you are right, I totally misread
<a name="l-156"></a><span class="tm">18:37:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;KostyaSha&gt;</span> about documentation i think no matter where and who wrote it
<a name="l-157"></a><span class="tm">18:37:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/CxSuite+Jenkins+Plugin is relevant to Jenkins, so I think this one is OK
<a name="l-158"></a><span class="tm">18:38:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;KostyaSha&gt;</span> wiki is just a trash can for pages :)
<a name="l-159"></a><span class="tm">18:38:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> I just wish it didn't read so much like marketing
<a name="l-160"></a><span class="tm">18:38:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;oleg-nenashev&gt;</span> I would +1 for such pages if they have a proper warning on the top of the page
<a name="l-161"></a><span class="tm">18:38:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> And link doens't even work :-(
<a name="l-162"></a><span class="tm">18:38:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;orrc&gt;</span> it seems redundant; people googling for that plugin will find their website
<a name="l-163"></a><span class="tm">18:38:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;KostyaSha&gt;</span> btw nowadays gh-pages also good, so wiki can be used as just a place for pages (not matter for what plugins), but +1 for warning about closed source/etc
<a name="l-164"></a><span class="tm">18:38:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> I clicked on this one at random thinking it was OSS, but it’s not: https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Config+Rotator+Plugin
<a name="l-165"></a><span class="tm">18:39:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> I like this approach, where they’ve got the company logo off on the side, but otherwise, it’s the standard plugin page.
<a name="l-166"></a><span class="tm">18:39:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> Right, +1 to what Praqma is doing
<a name="l-167"></a><span class="tm">18:39:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;danielbeck&gt;</span> https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Praqma ?
<a name="l-168"></a><span class="tm">18:40:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> And that one is open-source plugin
<a name="l-169"></a><span class="tm">18:40:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;KostyaSha&gt;</span> there are 2 places with praqma
<a name="l-170"></a><span class="tm">18:40:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> Perforce has a slightly different layout, but similar on concept: https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/P4+Plugin
<a name="l-171"></a><span class="tm">18:40:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> Although these are still open sourced, just maintained by a commercial company.
<a name="l-172"></a><span class="tm">18:40:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;oleg-nenashev&gt;</span> I suppose Praqma does the things well in the case of OSS plugins on the main jenkins repo
<a name="l-173"></a><span class="tm">18:41:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;orrc&gt;</span> I think non-OSS plugins should not have wiki pages (so no CxSuite Plugin)
<a name="l-174"></a><span class="tm">18:41:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;orrc&gt;</span> the https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Commercial+Support page can mention the companies and have an external link, but there should not be a further page like the standalone Praqma page
<a name="l-175"></a><span class="tm">18:41:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> Yeah, I think I agree with orrc.
<a name="l-176"></a><span class="tm">18:42:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;KostyaSha&gt;</span> first of all i think that all jenkinsci plugins must have wiki page
<a name="l-177"></a><span class="tm">18:42:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> OK, so maybe we'll move a bit of this in https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Commercial+Support and delete the page itself?
<a name="l-178"></a><span class="tm">18:42:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;oleg-nenashev&gt;</span> I see no problem in such company page if it's organized properly and moved to a dedicated folder.
<a name="l-179"></a><span class="tm">18:42:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> I should probably notify the author as well if we are to do that
<a name="l-180"></a><span class="tm">18:43:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;KostyaSha&gt;</span> kohsuke,  there is no clear strategy about confluence at all, this discussion becomes randoom, plugins, companies
<a name="l-181"></a><span class="tm">18:43:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;KostyaSha&gt;</span> praqma has 2 spaces: 1) mentioned on this page 2) separate page
<a name="l-182"></a><span class="tm">18:43:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> Commercial Support seems a little bit different than commercial/closed source plugins.
<a name="l-183"></a><span class="tm">18:44:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;orrc&gt;</span> so is the original question is answered? maybe the tangential topics can go to the dev list / another meeting?
<a name="l-184"></a><span class="tm">18:44:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;danielbeck&gt;</span> If the concern is that the community should be able to step in if maintainers lose interest, it's pretty clear that plugins must be completely integrated in Jenkins infra. That means code hosted primarily in (and released from) @jenkinsci/our SVN; use of Jira, having a wiki page and linking that from the POM. Only then does distribution via our UC make sense.
<a name="l-185"></a><span class="tm">18:44:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;danielbeck&gt;</span> And use of the Jenkins infra must in turn require being an OSS plugin.
<a name="l-186"></a><span class="tm">18:44:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> danielbeck I don’t see how we can do that for a commercial/closed source plugin
<a name="l-187"></a><span class="tm">18:45:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;teilo&gt;</span> +1 for what danielbeck said
<a name="l-188"></a><span class="tm">18:45:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;danielbeck&gt;</span> hare_brain Well, we don't. You're free to write whatever you want, but you don't get any of the project infra for it.
<a name="l-189"></a><span class="tm">18:45:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;danielbeck&gt;</span> That means no UC distribution, no wiki pages, and no issue tracker.
<a name="l-190"></a><span class="tm">18:46:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;teilo&gt;</span> should we should perhaps allow a commecial plugin to be distributed if the compnay makes a donation?
<a name="l-191"></a><span class="tm">18:46:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;danielbeck&gt;</span> teilo -1
<a name="l-192"></a><span class="tm">18:46:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> Ugh. Would rather not get into *that* conversation. :)
<a name="l-193"></a><span class="tm">18:46:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;KostyaSha&gt;</span> there is no guarantee for plugins that random persons wouldn't commit to it directly

<a name="l-195"></a><span class="tm">18:46:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">orrc:</span> I think the emerging consensus seems to be that proprietary Jenkins plugins aren't welcome on our Wiki
<a name="l-196"></a><span class="tm">18:46:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;danielbeck&gt;</span> kohsuke ... and UC
<a name="l-197"></a><span class="tm">18:46:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> (trying to bring the conversation back to the original question)
<a name="l-198"></a><span class="tm">18:47:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;KostyaSha&gt;</span> teilo, i think better create infra that will allow working with additional UCs
<a name="l-199"></a><span class="tm">18:47:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">danielbeck:</span> Yes, and I was wrong in assuming that domi was asking for that, which he wasn't.
<a name="l-200"></a><span class="tm">18:47:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;oleg-nenashev&gt;</span> We cannot easily distinguish commercial and non-commercial plugins
<a name="l-201"></a><span class="tm">18:47:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;KostyaSha&gt;</span> even 'personal update centers' like it done in linux distros
<a name="l-202"></a><span class="tm">18:47:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;oleg-nenashev&gt;</span> <span class="hi">KostaSha:</span> There's a support of multiple UCs
<a name="l-203"></a><span class="tm">18:47:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;orrc&gt;</span> this is off-topic, but there are legit reasons to host OSS plugins outside of jenkinsci, e.g. a company has their own github organisation, wants to manage users there, use gitter IM and other tools that require admin access.  if the plugin does end up abandoned and the community wants to take over maintainership, the plugin can be forked into jenkinsci
<a name="l-204"></a><span class="tm">18:48:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;KostyaSha&gt;</span> oleg-nenashev, there is no good integration and etc. If it not user friendly then nobody will use it
<a name="l-205"></a><span class="tm">18:48:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;danielbeck&gt;</span> KostyaSha Is this really essential to this discussion?
<a name="l-206"></a><span class="tm">18:48:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;orrc&gt;</span> <span class="hi">kohsuke:</span> ok, consensus is good. can we move on? :)
<a name="l-207"></a><span class="tm">18:48:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> So no wiki page for something like CxSuite. But do we offer some place for them to have a link?
<a name="l-208"></a><span class="tm">18:48:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;KostyaSha&gt;</span> danielbeck, imho all this questions related, just deprecated closed source plugins is not a solution

<a name="l-213"></a><span class="tm">18:49:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> Maybe just carve off a “Commercial Plugins” section on the plugins that points them off to their site?
<a name="l-214"></a><span class="tm">18:50:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;orrc&gt;</span> nobody comes to the wiki searching for plugins. you hit the wiki from google. so somebody searching for "jenkins cxsuite" will hit that company's documentation for the plugin

<a name="l-293"></a><span class="tm">19:10:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;KostyaSha&gt;</span> so 1.610 is not something well used/reported at all

<a name="l-301"></a><span class="tm">19:11:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;danielbeck&gt;</span> jglick That would be a definite backport IMO

<a name="l-304"></a><span class="tm">19:12:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;KostyaSha&gt;</span> i think &gt;1.610 is not well tested at all, is there any statistics about number of installations?

<a name="l-307"></a><span class="tm">19:12:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jglick&gt;</span> <span class="hi">danielbeck:</span> yes those should be fixed in 1.612 already (merged today)
<a name="l-308"></a><span class="tm">19:12:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;danielbeck&gt;</span> jglick Is the fix something that should resolve it for other plugins with similar issues as well?

<a name="l-368"></a><span class="tm">19:28:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;KostyaSha&gt;</span> but lts must be 1.6?
<a name="l-369"></a><span class="tm">19:28:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;danielbeck&gt;</span> but why would 1.609 be worse than 1.607? both have the descriptor issue, and need a minor queue fix?
<a name="l-370"></a><span class="tm">19:28:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;danielbeck&gt;</span> otherwise they seem identical
<a name="l-371"></a><span class="tm">19:28:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;KostyaSha&gt;</span> 7+ requirement can be reverted as  i see
<a name="l-372"></a><span class="tm">19:29:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;teilo&gt;</span> I thought the next LTS would be Java7.
<a name="l-373"></a><span class="tm">19:29:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jglick&gt;</span> Yes the 7+ requirement is so far a small patch, easily reverted (that was intentional).
<a name="l-374"></a><span class="tm">19:29:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jglick&gt;</span> (Or easily backported if we pick a pre-1.612 and want the LTS to be 7+.)
<a name="l-375"></a><span class="tm">19:30:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jglick:</span> is getting 1.607 as the base line no good for the workflow stuff, compared to 1.606?
<a name="l-376"></a><span class="tm">19:30:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;KostyaSha&gt;</span> so it not issue, ok
<a name="l-377"></a><span class="tm">19:30:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jglick&gt;</span> <span class="hi">kohsuke:</span> 1.607 is better than 1.606, and 1.609 is better than both
<a name="l-378"></a><span class="tm">19:30:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jglick&gt;</span> (from that limited perspective)
<a name="l-379"></a><span class="tm">19:30:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> Thanks
<a name="l-380"></a><span class="tm">19:31:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;danielbeck&gt;</span> jglick Would we want to backport the descriptor changes to LTS?
<a name="l-381"></a><span class="tm">19:31:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ogondza&gt;</span> sorry I really have to run now
<a name="l-382"></a><span class="tm">19:31:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;teilo&gt;</span> my bad - I thought we had said that the next LTS would be java7, but we said it could be 1.7
<a name="l-383"></a><span class="tm">19:31:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;oleg-nenashev&gt;</span> If we take 1.609, than we backport everything from 1.610. So it makes sense to increment the version
<a name="l-384"></a><span class="tm">19:31:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jglick&gt;</span> I feel like the discussion is confused because we have a pseudo-train model, and have conflicting considerations of user features (or major fixes), APIs, and avoiding regressions.
<a name="l-385"></a><span class="tm">19:32:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">danielbeck:</span> I think I propose 1.607. It has some issues, but fixes can be backported, and it's older and that brings some comfort.
<a name="l-386"></a><span class="tm">19:32:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jglick&gt;</span> <span class="hi">oleg-nenashev:</span> the tar change would have to be reverted if we started with 1.610. Not that that is difficult, just pointing it out.
<a name="l-387"></a><span class="tm">19:32:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;KostyaSha&gt;</span> jglick, because of tar this version was not well used, what other changes does it have?
<a name="l-388"></a><span class="tm">19:33:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;danielbeck&gt;</span> the descriptor fix
<a name="l-389"></a><span class="tm">19:33:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;danielbeck&gt;</span> was added in 1.610 as well
<a name="l-390"></a><span class="tm">19:33:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;KostyaSha&gt;</span> remoting update?
<a name="l-391"></a><span class="tm">19:33:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;danielbeck&gt;</span> which required rework in 1.611 and 1.612
<a name="l-392"></a><span class="tm">19:34:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jglick&gt;</span> Yeah, starting from 1.607 I would *propose* backporting a series of Descriptor fixes, but can certainly understand getting pushback on that.
