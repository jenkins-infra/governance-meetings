<a name="l-22"></a><span class="tm">19:11:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke__&gt;</span> jenkins-reviewbot is the actual artifactId of the plugin, huh

<a name="l-25"></a><span class="tm">19:12:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;oleg-nenashev&gt;</span> I would also propose to slightly update plugin-info macro to explicitly show jiraComponent
<a name="l-26"></a><span class="tm">19:12:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;oleg-nenashev&gt;</span> In such case we would avoid possible confusions
<a name="l-27"></a><span class="tm">19:12:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke__&gt;</span> OK, why is that?
<a name="l-28"></a><span class="tm">19:13:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke__&gt;</span> Since danielbe_ isn't here, let's talk about other stuff
<a name="l-29"></a><span class="tm">19:13:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;oleg-nenashev&gt;</span> Currently, there's only a hyperlink to open issues. BTW, a user won't notice if the jraComponent is invalid

<a name="l-32"></a><span class="tm">19:14:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;oleg-nenashev&gt;</span> An additional info row with an embedded validadion would be great
<a name="l-33"></a><span class="tm">19:14:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke__&gt;</span> so you want to have it jump to the component page, like https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS/component/15803
<a name="l-34"></a><span class="tm">19:14:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;oleg-nenashev&gt;</span> Yes, it makes sense as well

<a name="l-36"></a><span class="tm">19:15:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke__&gt;</span> sounds like another INFRA issue
<a name="l-37"></a><span class="tm">19:15:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;oleg-nenashev&gt;</span> yep
<a name="l-38"></a><span class="tm">19:15:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;oleg-nenashev&gt;</span> I haven't submitted it yet
<a name="l-39"></a><span class="tm">19:16:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke__&gt;</span> <span class="cmd">#idea </span><span class="cmdline">Plugin masthead in Wiki should land to the component page like https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS/component/15803#selectedTab=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.project%3Acomponent-issues-panel</span>
<a name="l-40"></a><span class="tm">19:16:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke__&gt;</span> oops
<a name="l-41"></a><span class="tm">19:16:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;oleg-nenashev&gt;</span> I can easily implement it, but a test environment would be useful. A support from INFRA owners is required to update the plugin as well
<a name="l-42"></a><span class="tm">19:16:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke__&gt;</span> I thinke the challenge in linking to the component page is to figure out the component ID from the component name
<a name="l-43"></a><span class="tm">19:16:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;oleg-nenashev&gt;</span> <span class="hi">kohsuke:</span> How long did it take to update the plugin?
<a name="l-44"></a><span class="tm">19:17:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke__&gt;</span> Something has to run elsewhere asynchronously to generate such mapping as redirector
<a name="l-45"></a><span class="tm">19:17:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;oleg-nenashev&gt;</span> <span class="hi">kohsuke:</span> AFAIK JIRA REST API has such command
<a name="l-46"></a><span class="tm">19:17:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke__&gt;</span> Deploying the Confluence plugin itself is very quick. Cache regeneration will then take some more time
<a name="l-47"></a><span class="tm">19:18:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke__&gt;</span> But all in all, deploying a new version is an easy process
<a name="l-48"></a><span class="tm">19:18:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke__&gt;</span> Can we move on to the next topic?

<a name="l-52"></a><span class="tm">19:20:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke__&gt;</span> The conversation didn't go further beyond the initial round, so I am hoping to hear from more of you
<a name="l-53"></a><span class="tm">19:20:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke__&gt;</span> <span class="hi">hare_brain:</span> abayer: I hope you guys are here
<a name="l-54"></a><span class="tm">19:20:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> I’m here
<a name="l-55"></a><span class="tm">19:21:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke__&gt;</span> Or is this something not too many people just don't care about?
<a name="l-56"></a><span class="tm">19:21:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke__&gt;</span> I meant "most people just don't care about"
<a name="l-57"></a><span class="tm">19:22:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke__&gt;</span> I'm sort of between a rock and a hard place.
<a name="l-58"></a><span class="tm">19:22:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> I hope *some* people care about it. Because we could really use other opinions.
<a name="l-59"></a><span class="tm">19:22:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke__&gt;</span> Exactly
<a name="l-60"></a><span class="tm">19:23:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;oleg-nenashev&gt;</span> <span class="hi">kohsuke__:</span> I have not a strong opinion on the naming pattern. But it definitely makes sense to define a common standard [post-factum?]
<a name="l-61"></a><span class="tm">19:25:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke_&gt;</span> Yes, I tried to phrase it as much about approving a pattern as these specific names
<a name="l-62"></a><span class="tm">19:25:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;oleg-nenashev&gt;</span> It also makes sense to agree on names for non-commercial solutions. There're plenty of "MyMegaJenkins" names on presentations. It's not bad, but it seems to be a grey zone as well
<a name="l-63"></a><span class="tm">19:27:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke_&gt;</span> Technically, I don't think the commercial / non-commercial nature of the mark usage affects the policy --- for example Apache rules about their trademarks do not distinguish commercial/non-commercial
<a name="l-64"></a><span class="tm">19:27:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> I would say that it’s actually *less* about the pattern and *more* about protecting the trademark, and ensuring that it continues to be associated with the project first.
<a name="l-65"></a><span class="tm">19:28:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke_&gt;</span> OK. I thought you are for guidelines that help deciding on these things more smoothly as opposed to look at individual cases individually.
<a name="l-66"></a><span class="tm">19:30:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> Well, guidelines may help decide, but the criteria, IMO, should always be, what effect does a request have on the trademark?
<a name="l-67"></a><span class="tm">19:30:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke_&gt;</span> Did my response to you about which way the confusion goes score any points?
<a name="l-68"></a><span class="tm">19:31:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;autojack&gt;</span> hi
<a name="l-69"></a><span class="tm">19:31:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;autojack&gt;</span> I am reading.
<a name="l-70"></a><span class="tm">19:31:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> No, not really. :) I had considered and acknowledged the reverse meritocracy point before. It *is* unfair to CloudBees.
<a name="l-71"></a><span class="tm">19:32:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke_&gt;</span> ... that the question at hand is whether proposed "AcmeCorp Jenkins Enterprise" confuses people whether it is from AcmeCorp or Jenkins
<a name="l-72"></a><span class="tm">19:32:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> And to be clear, my position has always been one of concern, not objection.
<a name="l-73"></a><span class="tm">19:32:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> If no one else is worried about it, then I wouldn’t object to the specific request from CloudBees.
<a name="l-74"></a><span class="tm">19:32:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke_&gt;</span> It is not about whether people get confused about where Jenkins effort is from, which I sense is your main concern.
<a name="l-75"></a><span class="tm">19:33:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;oleg-nenashev&gt;</span> I'd say "CloudBees Jenkins ..." is the only one real confusion now. I know many people, who have been confused by it
<a name="l-76"></a><span class="tm">19:34:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;oleg-nenashev&gt;</span> BTW, in case of CB it's fair to leave things as is
<a name="l-77"></a><span class="tm">19:34:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke_&gt;</span> <span class="hi">oleg-nenashev:</span> you know many people who have been confused what with what?
<a name="l-78"></a><span class="tm">19:35:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;oleg-nenashev&gt;</span> <span class="hi">kohsuke_:</span> Many my previous colleagues and contacts thought that Jenkins is a product from Cloudbees
<a name="l-79"></a><span class="tm">19:35:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke_&gt;</span> Do I get it right that you feel the same as hare_brain , that "AcmeCorp Jenkins FooBarZot" is OK for general AcmeCorp but not for CloudBees?
<a name="l-80"></a><span class="tm">19:35:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke_&gt;</span> OK
<a name="l-81"></a><span class="tm">19:35:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;oleg-nenashev&gt;</span> <span class="hi">kohsuke_:</span> No
<a name="l-82"></a><span class="tm">19:36:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;oleg-nenashev&gt;</span> <span class="hi">kohsuke:</span> In my opinion, there's no problem with Cloudbees. I'm OK with current names
<a name="l-83"></a><span class="tm">19:36:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke_&gt;</span> Just to make sure, current names are "Jenkins Enterprise by CloudBees"
<a name="l-84"></a><span class="tm">19:36:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke_&gt;</span> The new name being requested is "CloudBees Jenkins Enterprise"
<a name="l-85"></a><span class="tm">19:36:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke_&gt;</span> (there are a few more requests here but they all follow the same pattern)
<a name="l-86"></a><span class="tm">19:37:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;oleg-nenashev&gt;</span> People will invert words in any case :(
<a name="l-87"></a><span class="tm">19:38:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke_&gt;</span> Sorry for being slow, but I'm just trying to understand what you are OK with
<a name="l-88"></a><span class="tm">19:38:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;oleg-nenashev&gt;</span> No problem, it's probably caused by my English
<a name="l-89"></a><span class="tm">19:38:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;oleg-nenashev&gt;</span> I'm OK with both namings
<a name="l-90"></a><span class="tm">19:39:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> “…that "AcmeCorp Jenkins FooBarZot" is OK for general AcmeCorp but not for CloudBees?”
<a name="l-91"></a><span class="tm">19:39:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;autojack&gt;</span> my two cents: purely from the perspective of readability, limiting confusion, and so on, I think I prefer the 'Jenkins Foo by SomeCompany' convention over 'SomeCompany Jenkins Foo.'
<a name="l-92"></a><span class="tm">19:39:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> Oops
<a name="l-93"></a><span class="tm">19:39:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;autojack&gt;</span> I like that it makes it clear that this is a Jenkins improvement brought to you by SomeCompany.
<a name="l-94"></a><span class="tm">19:39:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> What I mean to continue with, is that “AcmeCorp Jenkins FooBarZot” is more likely to dilute the mark than the currently approved pattern.
<a name="l-95"></a><span class="tm">19:39:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;oleg-nenashev&gt;</span> Yes! I found it: http://docs.pivotal.io/cloudbees/Jenkins.html
<a name="l-96"></a><span class="tm">19:40:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke_&gt;</span> All right, is it fair if I send another email to that thread saying the board will approve the request in 2 weeks unless we hear from people?
<a name="l-97"></a><span class="tm">19:40:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> When it’s CloudBees instead the place of AcmeCorp, the likelihood of trademark dilution is higher.
<a name="l-98"></a><span class="tm">19:41:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke_&gt;</span> I take it back. I didn't notice there are more messages to scroll
<a name="l-99"></a><span class="tm">19:41:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke_&gt;</span> grr, I'll ask Pivotal doc to be updated
<a name="l-100"></a><span class="tm">19:42:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;oleg-nenashev&gt;</span> Example #2: https://opensourcearchitect.co/education/cloudbees/jenkins-2-day
<a name="l-101"></a><span class="tm">19:42:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;oleg-nenashev&gt;</span> I'd say the logo could be updated as well :)
<a name="l-102"></a><span class="tm">19:43:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;oleg-nenashev&gt;</span> BTW, it is not very related to the discussion
<a name="l-103"></a><span class="tm">19:43:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke_&gt;</span> <span class="hi">autojack:</span> it's kind of ironic that a part of the motivation for the new name request, as I believe, is to put more emphasis on CloudBees
<a name="l-104"></a><span class="tm">19:44:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> Which is a valid motivation for CloudBees.:)
<a name="l-105"></a><span class="tm">19:44:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;oleg-nenashev&gt;</span> Definitely
<a name="l-106"></a><span class="tm">19:44:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;autojack&gt;</span> yeah. well I think that's what hare_brain is hesitant about.
<a name="l-107"></a><span class="tm">19:44:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;autojack&gt;</span> the open question I guess is whether we think that impacts the Jenkins brand and mark negatively or positively.
<a name="l-108"></a><span class="tm">19:45:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> The *independence* of the brand and mark.
<a name="l-109"></a><span class="tm">19:45:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;autojack&gt;</span> I don't have a burning desk-pounding opinion about it, but I'm glad we're being sensitive to it.
<a name="l-110"></a><span class="tm">19:45:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> Where is rtyler?
<a name="l-111"></a><span class="tm">19:46:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;autojack&gt;</span> (I would also hesitate to put much weight in my opinion because I'm not some heroic longtime contributor :)
<a name="l-112"></a><span class="tm">19:46:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> autojack, I think that’s why opinions like yours matter actually
<a name="l-113"></a><span class="tm">19:46:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;autojack&gt;</span> heh
<a name="l-114"></a><span class="tm">19:47:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;oleg-nenashev&gt;</span> Does CloudBess consider convenient solutions?
<a name="l-115"></a><span class="tm">19:47:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;autojack&gt;</span> asking myself: what's the difference I perceive between 'Jenkins Enterprise by CloudBees' and 'CloudBees Jenkins Enterprise?'
<a name="l-116"></a><span class="tm">19:48:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;autojack&gt;</span> my gut says the first is CloudBees improvements to an OSS project, the second is CB contributing the lion's share of the improvements.
<a name="l-117"></a><span class="tm">19:48:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;autojack&gt;</span> just based on reading it.
<a name="l-118"></a><span class="tm">19:48:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;autojack&gt;</span> to me it's a question of what these names communicate to the community at large.
<a name="l-119"></a><span class="tm">19:49:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;autojack&gt;</span> would people start wondering, is CloudBees Jenkins a fork like Jenkins/Hudson?
<a name="l-120"></a><span class="tm">19:50:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke_&gt;</span> <span class="hi">autojack:</span> So I think you are saying that you actually like Jenkins is the front &amp; center of the focus in the name
<a name="l-121"></a><span class="tm">19:50:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;autojack&gt;</span> yes.
<a name="l-122"></a><span class="tm">19:50:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke_&gt;</span> In that line of rasoning, if CloudBees decided to drop the reference of Jenkins altogether and just call it something else completely, like just "FooBarZot", then you wouldn't like it either
<a name="l-123"></a><span class="tm">19:51:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;roac&gt;</span> Hi. I manually put in a locally compiled version of junit plugin. Everything works fine. But in the Job's home page I see that there are 2 links to "Latest Test Result" with 2 corresponding graphs.
<a name="l-124"></a><span class="tm">19:51:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;roac&gt;</span> Did i miss something.
<a name="l-125"></a><span class="tm">19:51:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;autojack&gt;</span> but I can imagine CB saying, hey, we have contributed a LOT to make Enterprise different, we should get first billing.
<a name="l-126"></a><span class="tm">19:51:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke_&gt;</span> As in, the question of "is FooBarZot a fork like Jenkins/Hudson?" would be still valid, no?
<a name="l-127"></a><span class="tm">19:51:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;oleg-nenashev&gt;</span> Jenkins can be at the end
<a name="l-128"></a><span class="tm">19:51:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;autojack&gt;</span> <span class="hi">roac:</span> community meeting in progress, can you wait a few minutes?
<a name="l-129"></a><span class="tm">19:51:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;roac&gt;</span> Sorry. Sure.
<a name="l-130"></a><span class="tm">19:51:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;autojack&gt;</span> <span class="hi">roac:</span> thanks :)
<a name="l-131"></a><span class="tm">19:52:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;danielbe_&gt;</span> oleg-nenashev kohsuke_  My apologies for missing the meeting
<a name="l-132"></a><span class="tm">19:52:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke_&gt;</span> no problem
<a name="l-133"></a><span class="tm">19:52:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke_&gt;</span> Do you have any thoughts on this name topic?
<a name="l-134"></a><span class="tm">19:52:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;oleg-nenashev&gt;</span> The mixing is a real topic. "Cloudbees CI Enterprise. Powered by Jenkins" would be ok
<a name="l-135"></a><span class="tm">19:53:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;danielbe_&gt;</span> sorry need to catch up the last 30 minutes
<a name="l-136"></a><span class="tm">19:53:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;autojack&gt;</span> <span class="hi">kohsuke_:</span> well, if they dropped the reference to Jenkins I might wonder, is this even a Jenkins plugin/product or some stand-alone thing?
<a name="l-137"></a><span class="tm">19:55:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke_&gt;</span> I do want to have "Jenkins" in the name because JEbC *is* Jenkins.
<a name="l-138"></a><span class="tm">19:55:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;autojack&gt;</span> right
<a name="l-139"></a><span class="tm">19:55:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;autojack&gt;</span> I guess if we take your Linux example, we have Red Hat Linux, Ubuntu Linux, Debian GNU/Linux...
<a name="l-140"></a><span class="tm">19:56:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> Which one do you think of first, when someone says just “Linux”?
<a name="l-141"></a><span class="tm">19:56:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke_&gt;</span> And I do appreciate the concern that there might be a growing confusion out there that Jenkins is a CloudBees effort instead of the community effort, to me that's an independent problem, because I honestly don't see how CJE would be any more confusing than JEbC
<a name="l-142"></a><span class="tm">19:56:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;autojack&gt;</span> duh, TurboLinux of course...
<a name="l-143"></a><span class="tm">19:56:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;autojack&gt;</span> ;)
<a name="l-144"></a><span class="tm">19:56:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;autojack&gt;</span> <span class="hi">kohsuke_:</span> yeah your point is valid.
<a name="l-145"></a><span class="tm">19:58:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke_&gt;</span> In Linux example, if none of those vendors are allowed to use the mark Linux to refer to their Linux distros, I think it would have had a negative impact over all.
<a name="l-146"></a><span class="tm">19:58:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;autojack&gt;</span> <span class="hi">hare_brain:</span> I tend to make the distinction between Linux, the kernel, and e.g. Red Hat Linux the distro.
<a name="l-147"></a><span class="tm">19:58:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;autojack&gt;</span> agreed.
<a name="l-148"></a><span class="tm">19:58:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;danielbe_&gt;</span> kohsuke_ It's easier to interpet CJE as CJ...E, as in, there's also a "CloudBees Jenkins (regular)"
<a name="l-149"></a><span class="tm">19:58:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;autojack&gt;</span> ALTHOUGH THEY SHOULD ALL BE CALLING IT GNU/LINUX &lt;/rms&gt;
<a name="l-150"></a><span class="tm">19:59:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke_&gt;</span> <span class="hi">danielbe_:</span> I see, I didn't think of that way, but I get that
<a name="l-151"></a><span class="tm">20:00:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;autojack&gt;</span> maybe we should just poll everyone here now that we've kicked this back and forth.
<a name="l-152"></a><span class="tm">20:00:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> That’s sort of what we were hoping for!
<a name="l-153"></a><span class="tm">20:01:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> And I encourage people to speak up.
<a name="l-154"></a><span class="tm">20:01:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;autojack&gt;</span> the proposal is to generally allow uses that fit the pattern 'SomeCo Jenkins Product' in addition to 'Jenkins Product by SomeCo.'
<a name="l-155"></a><span class="tm">20:01:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;autojack&gt;</span> (still subject to vote, right?)
<a name="l-156"></a><span class="tm">20:01:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke_&gt;</span> Yes, each usage needs to be requested and approved
<a name="l-157"></a><span class="tm">20:01:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;autojack&gt;</span> (so I can't release Jenkins Sucks by Oracle [SECRETLY INSTALLS HUDSON])
<a name="l-158"></a><span class="tm">20:02:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> We could always say that we’re giving CloudBees special dispensation for that format, and not approve the pattern for general usage.
<a name="l-159"></a><span class="tm">20:02:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;autojack&gt;</span> I think that's a slippery slope.
<a name="l-160"></a><span class="tm">20:02:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke_&gt;</span> ha!
<a name="l-161"></a><span class="tm">20:02:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;autojack&gt;</span> my instinct is that the same policy should apply to any user.
<a name="l-162"></a><span class="tm">20:03:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> I put that on the table to acknowledge the overweight contributions that CloudBees is now making to the community
<a name="l-163"></a><span class="tm">20:03:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;autojack&gt;</span> right now I still feel like I prefer not to approve the new proposal. but I still don't have a strong fiery opinion.
<a name="l-164"></a><span class="tm">20:03:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;autojack&gt;</span> yeah, I would just worry about having to approve further special exceptions for other big contributors down the line or something. I dunno.
<a name="l-165"></a><span class="tm">20:05:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke_&gt;</span> Hmm
<a name="l-166"></a><span class="tm">20:05:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> I think this would actually be an easier decision if there *were* other big contributors.
<a name="l-167"></a><span class="tm">20:06:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;autojack&gt;</span> I was just thinking that.
<a name="l-168"></a><span class="tm">20:06:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;danielbe_&gt;</span> are these product names reserved for contributors to the community?
<a name="l-169"></a><span class="tm">20:07:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> danielbe_ that’s an interesting question!
<a name="l-170"></a><span class="tm">20:07:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke_&gt;</span> It's dificult to imagine how anyone serious enough to put a product name like that out there can do it without being a contribuor
<a name="l-171"></a><span class="tm">20:08:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;danielbe_&gt;</span> kohsuke_ Just don't push fixes upstream. It's MIT.
<a name="l-172"></a><span class="tm">20:08:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> Yep
<a name="l-173"></a><span class="tm">20:08:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke_&gt;</span> That's called forking and those people will not want to use the same name
<a name="l-174"></a><span class="tm">20:08:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> The fact that the community owns the trademark gives us a lot of leverage about that.
<a name="l-175"></a><span class="tm">20:09:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke_&gt;</span> Right
<a name="l-176"></a><span class="tm">20:10:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke_&gt;</span> If we feel that someone is using the name Jenkins to refer to something not quite Jenkins in ways that create confusion, we can stop that
<a name="l-177"></a><span class="tm">20:10:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> I guess in all likelihood, if some organization tried to create a product based on Jenkins and there were no contributions, we would not grant them the right to use the trademark.
<a name="l-178"></a><span class="tm">20:11:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke_&gt;</span> That's the canonical use case for marks, IIUC.
<a name="l-179"></a><span class="tm">20:11:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> Perhaps. I just hadn’t considered that angle before.
<a name="l-180"></a><span class="tm">20:12:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> I just assumed that the requests would all come from someone who participates in the community.
<a name="l-181"></a><span class="tm">20:12:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;oleg-nenashev&gt;</span> Does Jenkins have a registered trademark BTW?
<a name="l-182"></a><span class="tm">20:13:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke_&gt;</span> I need to look at the exact status with SPI, but the application is being processed
<a name="l-183"></a><span class="tm">20:13:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke_&gt;</span> I've seen some email back and forth that has been going on for years now
<a name="l-184"></a><span class="tm">20:15:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> It’s 12:15 (PST). Poll?
<a name="l-185"></a><span class="tm">20:15:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke_&gt;</span> Yes, let's try to bring this to some kind of conclusion
<a name="l-186"></a><span class="tm">20:15:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;danielbe_&gt;</span> what specifically? CloudBees' use of the specific CJE name?
<a name="l-187"></a><span class="tm">20:15:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> I am sure that kosuke_ wants resolution. It’s dragged on for long enough.
<a name="l-188"></a><span class="tm">20:15:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;autojack&gt;</span> agreed. my instinct still says to stick with the existing scheme only, not the proposed.
<a name="l-189"></a><span class="tm">20:16:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;autojack&gt;</span> so that's my vote.
<a name="l-190"></a><span class="tm">20:16:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke_&gt;</span> The question for poll is, should the project approve "CloudBees Jenkins Enterprise" (and 2 other variants)
